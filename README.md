# Risk of Rain 2 Fun House
### v26.0 - "The Surgeon" Release

**Risk of Rain 2 Fun House** is an advanced, external automation dashboard for *Risk of Rain 2*. It functions as a "Dungeon Master" console, allowing players to build loadouts, spawn specific bosses, control mob flows, and synchronize their data across machines via GitHub.

Unlike standard mods, this tool runs externally (Python) and interacts with the game via the Developer Console (`cheats 1`) and the `Player.log` file, ensuring compatibility without modifying game binaries.

## 📂 Repository Structure & Architecture

The program follows a **Hybrid-Core Architecture**. It possesses a hardcoded "Skeleton" of essential game data to ensure it never crashes on load, but it relies on a sophisticated **Wiki Mining Engine** to populate its database with high-resolution assets and up-to-date stats.

🧠 The "Surgeon" Mining EngineTechnical Breakdown of WikiSyncEngine class in architect.pyThe defining feature of v26.0 is its ability to scrape Risk of Rain 2 Wiki.gg with surgical precision. It does not rely on fragile API calls for lists; it parses the HTML structure of the page to categorize items exactly as a human would see them.1. The Priority Map (Logic Gate)To prevent miscategorization (e.g., preventing Lunar Equipment from falling into the standard Equipment bucket), the scraper parses the Wiki page in a strict priority order based on HTML Header <h2> tags:Void Items (Category:Void_items)Lunar Equipment (Crucial Separation: Blue Actives)Lunar Items (Blue Passives)Boss Items (Yellow)Legendary Items (Red)Uncommon Items (Green)Common Items (White)Equipment (Orange - Standard Actives)Consumables/Meals (DLC)2. Dual-Layer Description ExtractionThe tool grabs data from two sources simultaneously to ensure the UI is informative:Layer 1 (The List View): It scrapes the HTML Table row for the item. It uses a heuristic algorithm to identify the "Brief Description" column (ignoring "Stacking Type" or "Cooldown" columns) to display concise stats like "Increases attack speed by 15%."Layer 2 (The Details Popup): It calls the MediaWiki API (action=query&prop=extracts) to pull the full, plain-text article for the item, providing notes, procs, and interaction details in the popup window.3. Lazy-Load Image BypassWiki.gg uses "Lazy Loading" to save bandwidth, meaning the src attribute of images is often a placeholder. The script detects the data-src attribute to pull the actual high-resolution texture directly from the table row.📚 The Great Archive (Item Database)State of the Game Data as of v26.0The program natively recognizes the following entities. Note that for standard items, the script dynamically mines them from the Wiki. For Bosses and Mobs, the script uses a verified internal ID map.1.

Installation & First RunClone this repository.Run architect.py.The First Run: The script will detect that ROR2_Data is empty. It will launch the Setup Window.Click "START MINE".The tool will scan riskofrain2.wiki.gg, mapping the headers and tables. It will download images and generate meta.json files for every item.Once complete, the Main Interface will open.2. Architect Mode (Item Injection)Selection: Click the item image or name to select it.Quantity: Enter the amount (or click "Set All 10" to quickly grab a stack).Trigger: Press the Hotkey (Default: F5 on Keyboard, or BTN_NORTH on Controller).Action: The script sends command inputs to the game console to give you the items.3. Director Mode (Spawning)Boss Rush: Select a Boss from the dropdown. Set Elite type (e.g., "Mending", "Voidtouched") and Team (Enemy/Ally).Mob Modifier: Select standard enemies.Queue System: You can add multiple spawn configs to a "Queue."Persistence: Enable the "Loop" to spawn the queue repeatedly on a timer (e.g., every 30 seconds).Smart Spawn: If checked, the script monitors Player.log. It will only spawn the next batch if the previous batch is dead (Enemy Count < 1).4. Cloud Sync (Git Integration)Push: In the Profile Manager, select a profile and click "PUSH." This uploads your loadout .json file to the GitHub repo.Pull: Clicking "PULL" scans the repo for any profiles that don't exist on your local machine and downloads them.Data Uplink: Use the upload_data.py script to upload the massive ROR2_Data folder (images/descriptions) to the repo, so other computers don't have to re-mine the Wiki.🛠️ Technical Notes & Wiki URL StructureThe tool relies on the following URL patterns on riskofrain2.wiki.gg:Main Index: https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/wiki/ItemsUsed for: Determining which items belong to which Rarity (Visual Scraping).API Endpoint: https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/api.phpUsed for: Fetching the extract (Full Description) and resolving File: paths for images.Item Pages: https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/wiki/[Item_Name_With_Underscores]Used for: The "Wiki" button in the details popup opens this URL in your browser.Development Note: If the Wiki layout changes significantly (e.g., they rename "Lunar Equipment" header to something else), the header_map dictionary in WikiSyncEngine.run_sync() must be updated to match the new HTML headers.
