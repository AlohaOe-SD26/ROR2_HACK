    "notes": "The Shaped Glass is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2. \nThe holder's base damage is doubled (x2 per stack), but in exchange, their total maximum health is halved (x0.5 per stack). Both these effects stack exponentially, meaning that stacking Shaped Glass will dramatically increase damage but reduce the holder's health to nearly nothing.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe main drawback of Shaped Glass is the removal of one-shot protection, meaning the player is always in danger of dying from a single attack. Strong-hitting enemies like the   Stone Golem become more threatening when holding this item.\nBarrier items like the  Topaz Brooch pair well with Shaped Glass, as barrier decays slower with lower maximum health and provides much-needed survivability.\n Tougher Times and  Repulsion Armor Plate are invaluable items to use with Shaped Glass. The Armor Plate mitigates damage-over-time effects such as{  Burn, and attacks from light-hitting enemies like the  Lesser Wisp.\nTougher Times's void counterpart,  Safer Spaces, may prove more reliable than its uncorrupted version, as it is guaranteed to block a hit. The  Oddly-shaped Opal provides a similar benefit, drastically reducing the damage from a single hit. However, players must be aware of these items' cooldowns.\nFixed damage, such as  N'kuhana's Opinion and  Helfire Tincture, is not increased by the Shaped Glass, since these items do not use the Survivor's base damage stat.\nThis also means that any total damage items activated by these sources, such as  AtG Missile Mk. 1 and  Ukulele, are not increased by the Shaped Glass.\nDue to the limits of the floating-point number system, Shaped Glass has a stacking limit of 127. When holding 128 or more, the holder's health rounds to 0 and they immediately die.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe damage is determined by the formula damage \u22c5 2 ^ amount\nThe maximum health is determined by the formula health \u22c5 0.5 ^ amount\n\n\n== Lore ==\n========================================\n====   MyBabel Machine Translator   ====\n====     [Version 12.45.1.009 ]   ======\n========================================\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <50912157 cycles>\nPaused...\nDisplay partial result?

Additionally, the death message while holding Shaped Glass is unique, displaying \"You have shattered into innumerable pieces.\"\nThis animation is identical to the one used when the player obliterates themself at the Obelisk in A Moment, Fractured. However, the character's model will ragdoll as if they died normally for a moment before shattering.",
