This means that in addition to survivors, monsters and drones can receive the weight if it killed another character with a Neutronium Weight.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nMass.\n\nSimple, featureless, and bland. But required.\n\nWe take mass, and bring it into being.\n\nSpace-time bends around mass. We call this gravity.\n\nThe more mass, the stronger the pull of gravity.\n\nLesser beings may buckle under the weight. Even light may succumb to mass's pull.\n\nFascinating.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAlloyed Collective\nAdded New Item: Neutronium Weight",
