    "notes": "The Hooks of Heresy are a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2 and a part of the Heresy Set, released in the Anniversary Update. They are unlocked and start appearing in runs after completing the Blockade Breaker Challenge.\nObtaining the Hooks of Heresy will replace the Survivor's secondary skill (M2 by default) with the Slicing Maelstrom skill.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nSince charging Slicing Maelstrom only increases the projectile's launch velocity, using it without charging at all is the most effective way to handle close-range targets.\n  Captain can benefit from this item, as it gives better crowd control options for him than   Power Tazer does and outscales Power Tazer in damage as well.\nObtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the   Heretic.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201c\u2026her arms were warped into terrible blades, so she may no longer find joy in study or tooling\u2026\u201d\n\n-The Evisceration of Kur-skan the Heretic, IV\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lunar Item: Hooks of Heresy\nAdded New Lore Entry: Hooks of Heresy",
