    "notes": "The Brainstalks are an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Deicide Challenge.\nWhen the holder kills an Elite enemy, all their skill cooldowns are {  temporarily reduced to the minimum of 0.5 seconds, for a duration of 4 seconds (+4 seconds per stack).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of no cooldowns is incorrect, since skills have a minimum of 0.5 second cooldown.\nWhile the {  No Cooldowns buff is active, the screen is tinted pink.\nThis item gets a near-permanent effect with the Artifact of Honor enabled.\nThe  Forgive Me Please will never trigger the Brainstalks' effect, even if theArtifact of Honor is enabled.\nSome skills can have their inputs held down for constant use of their skill during the buff, but others will require the input to be pressed again when they're off cooldown.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Brainstalks become progessively more powerful late-game as more monsters spawn as Elites, essentially completely replacing the needs for  Alien Head,  Hardlight Afterburner, or  Purity.\nWhile near-instant cooldowns are appealing on paper, remember that the time it takes to use a skill is also limited by how that skill may prevent others from being used. For instance, other skills cannot be used while charging   Loader's   Charged Gauntlet or   Artificer's   Charged Nano-Bomb. Other skills may lock the player into a scripted animation during which skills cannot be used, such as when   Bandit spins his gun while firing   Lights Out and   Desperado, or when Artificer uses   Flamethrower.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder:  Biopsy Samples of Cairne Jefferson\n\nTracking Number: 051*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 11/11/2056\n\nShipping Method: High Priority/Biological\n\nShipping Address: Saura Cosmo, Beacon Post, ???\n\nShipping Details:\n\nContained in this shipment should be a variety of biopsy samples from our late Mr. Jefferson. As you know, he was an extraordinary man in almost any manner. He was athletic, brilliant, kind, funny, and an all-around great human specimen. \n\nHe donated his body to science, and as we began the operation we found a most terrifying discovery.\n\nA quick visual examination of the subject\u2019s brain shows a very\u2026 particular oddity. It seems to be housing a variety of\u2026 glowing brain \u201cstalks\u201d, similar to tubeworms. Trying to biopsy the stalks is impossible - they seem to disintegrate into dust the moment we remove it from the brain. We cannot explain this oddity at all. As such, we have included the entire brain in this shipment.\n\nPlease let us know if you find any explanation.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Brainstalks\nGameplay Changes\nBuff Duration: 3s (+2s per stack) \u21d2 4s (+4s per stack)\n\ud83c\udf27Add slick camera effect when buff is active\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item is a brain with what look like brightly-colored cordyceps fungi sprouting out of it. The cordyceps are famous for their unique form of parasitism, growing inside and through an insect's head. Some cordyceps species even affect the insect's behavior.",
