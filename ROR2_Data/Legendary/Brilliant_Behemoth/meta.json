    "notes": "The Brilliant Behemoth is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \nAll the holder's attacks (including bonus attacks from items) create 4m (+2.5m per stack) explosions that deal 60% total damage. The radius of each explosion is multiplied by the attack's proc coefficient, so damage that has a proc coefficient of 0.0 (e.g.   Bleed from the  Tri-Tip Dagger) will not explode. \nThe explosion itself has a proc coefficient of 0.0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of (+1.5m per stack) is incorrect.\nUnlike all other total damage items, the Brilliant Behemoth strangely inherits the attack type of the triggering hit. This means that the explosion can:\nGrant stacks of   Bandit Skull when killing enemies, if the triggering hit is   Bandit's   Desperado.\nAdd an extra stack of   Expose when triggered by a hit that inflicts it.\nDeal additional damage from the Slayer keyword if the triggering attack has that keyword.\nInstantly kill enemies using the  Lost Seer's Lenses, if the triggering attack succeeded the instant-kill roll.\nBecause the Behemoth will not check if the enemy is a boss when inheriting the instant-kill type, this means that bosses are not immune to being instantly killed by the Behemoth if the player instantly kills a non-boss enemy that is close by (as bosses are only \"immune\" because the Lost Seer's Lenses will not roll the chance to kill them). This does not work on either of the       final bosses, however, as they are immune to this damage type altogether.\nAttacks create explosions when damaging an enemy or impacting a surface, even if the projectile is not destroyed on contact with terrain. This means that   Frag Grenades create explosions when bouncing off terrain, and the projectiles from the  Ceremonial Dagger and  Egocentrism will constantly explode when piercing through terrain.\nThis also means that an attack that normally explodes, such as   Charged Nano-Bomb, will create an additional explosion in the attack's center thanks to the Behemoth. However, any enemy damaged by the original explosion will also explode due to the Behemoth. If the enemy is close enough to the original explosion's center, it can take damage from the Behemoth twice: once from the explosion created by the attack's impact, and once from the explosion created when the attack damages it.\nThe same exploding effect occurs with the   Overloading exploding orbs.\nThe explosion will usually damage the enemy that the attack was triggered on, making Brilliant Behemoth at worst a flat +60% multiplicative damage upgrade in addition to potentially hitting other enemies with the explosions.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cLasers have their speed. Swords have their edge. Gases have their reach. \n\nBut let me tell you... Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, is as timeless as gunpowder. Just a pinch - jammed into a tight enough socket - and KABOOM! You got yourself not just a powerful weapon, but something that\u2019ll leave a lasting sense of fear in your enemies. I mean, nobody wants to be blown up, right?\u201d\n\n- Autobiography of Jans Czar, Modern King of Weaponry\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Brilliant Behemoth\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nDamage: 60% additive damage \u21d2 60% total damage\nBug Fixes\nPrevent attacks with proc coefficient 0 applying Crowd Control effects like the Behemoth\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nDue to how the Brilliant Behemoth inherits the triggering hit's attack type, it could theoretically inflict   Hemorrhage,   Poison, or   Blight when triggered by a corresponding skill. However, since the explosion's proc coefficient is 0.0, the debuffs have a duration of 0 seconds and are thus not inflicted at all.",
