    "notes": "The Aegis is an item introduced in the Scorched Acres Update.\nIf the holder receives healing while their health is full, they gain barriers equal to 50% (+50% per stack) of the healed amount.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item can be used to remove the downside that comes with the  Transcendence and  Shared Design, which normally make all healing items entirely worthless by changing the player's health into shields.\nThis does not work with percentage-based healing like  Bustling Fungus, since the Transcendence and Shared Design reduce the Fungus's healing to almost nothing.\nA critical-oriented healing build with  Harvester's Scythe can allow for easy barrier accumulation.\nOnce the player has accumulated enough proc items to cause a chain reaction, including on-hit healing items like Harvester's Scythe and Leeching Seed, one single hit can yield a massive burst of incoming healing, thereby making the barrier uptime trivial.\nBecause of how frequently  Bustling Fungus ticks, it is barely not enough to counteract the barrier decay with 2 stacks. But with 3+ stacks, there will be a positive accumulation of barrier. Similarly, 4 or more stacks of  Weeping Fungus also has the same positive effect.\nFor optimal barrier gain in conjunction with  Rejuvenation Rack, the amount of Aegis and Rejuvenation Racks should be equal, with Aegis taking priority. Optionally, the amount of Aegis can be two higher (but not three) than the amount of Rejuvenation Racks, instead of equal.\nThis table shows the first steps:\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Artifact E-8EE572\n\nTracking Number: 490******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 08/10/2056\n\nShipping Method: Priority\n\nShipping Address: Titan Museum of History and Culture, Titan\n\nSorry about the delay, we've had a flood of orders come in from this site. But it was exactly where you said we should look - there was a sealed off room where you marked the excavation diagram. I finished translating the engraving too, so consider that a bonus for the time we took to get to it:\n\n\"I am the will to survive made manifest. To those who never lose hope, to they who try in the face of impossible odds, I offer not \n\nprotection, but the means to bring one's unconquerable spirit forth as the defender of their mortal lives.\"\n\nIt\u2019s so lightweight, we figure it must've been entirely decorative. That seems to line up with the text. In any case, I hope it makes a good exhibit! I'm a big fan of the museum, so it wouldn't hurt to give me a partner's discount next time I visit, right?\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Aegis\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27\ufe0eHas been reworked in functionality\nBarrier gain from overheal is no longer capped\nNow grants barrier for 50% (+50% per stack) of the amount you overheal\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Item: Aegis",
