    "desc": "When a skill comes off cooldown, gain a temporary barrier for 1% (+0.25% per stack) of your maximum health per second of the skill's base cooldown.",
    "notes": "The Eclipse Lite is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Alloyed Collective expansion.\nWhenever any of the user's skills come off cooldown, they gain barrier equal to 1% (+0.25% per stack) of their maximum health per second of the skill's base cooldown.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nRegaining charges of a skill through  Backup Magazines,  Hardlight Afterburner, and  Lysate Cell does not apply barrier.\nSurvivors that naturaly have extra charges to their skills (  Acrid's leaps,   Railgunner's mines,  False Son's spikes) can recharge barrier simultaniously.\nIt takes around 11 Eclipse Lites to combat natural barrier decay on its own.\n  Bandit's Burst and Blast will not give barrier when reloading the barrel.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Mercenary can utilize the barrier gain very well due to his low skill cooldowns and   Expose  reducing them further.\n  Drifter's   Trash to Treasure passive can make Eclipse Lite more effective by reducing her skill cooldowns while she is holding  Item Scrap, Yellow.\n Brainstalks allows you to gain large amounts of barrier as skills recharge quickly.\n Bandolier will activate Eclipse Lite for every skill on cooldown.\nReducing skill cooldowns through  Purity and  Alien Head is recommended, as getting skill charges don't give barrier and leave more time for skills to stay off cooldown, reducing barrier gains.\n  Hungering Gaze grants a large amount of barrier when it reloads. This interaction may be unintended.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nWelcome to DataScraper (v3.1.53 \u2013 beta branch) \n\n$ Scraping memory... done. \n\n$ Resolving... done. \n\n$ Combing for relevant data... done. \n\nComplete! \n\nOutputting local audio transcriptions... \n\nProject G Commercial - Draft #05\n\n\"Man, killing these aliens has got me all tuckered out. I could sure use a drink that restores my energy AND quenches my thirst!\" Jean exclaimed as he finished off some Lemurians. \"But what could I find on this hostile alien planet?\" Out of the corner of his eye, Jean spots his saving grace - an Eclipse Lite, mercifully undamaged in an open crate. \"Eureka!\" Jean scooped up the perspiring bottle and hastily unscrewed the cap. Taking a swig, Jean exclaimed in joy. \"Wow, not only is it delicious, it's full of electrolytes! It's what thirsty soldiers on alien planets crave!
