    "notes": "The Crowbar is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the The Basics Challenge.\nWhen the holder attacks an enemy that has more than 90% of its health remaining, they deal 75% more damage (+75% per stack). \n\n\n== Notes ==\nAfter stacking two or more Crowbars, the total damage dealt is greater than a critical strike.\nThis item is best used with Survivors with high single-hit damage, such as   Loader,   Artificer,   Captain, and   Railgunner.\nHowever, all Survivors can make effective use of the Crowbar with equipment such as the  Preon Accumulator or  Royal Capacitor.\nThe bonus damage from the Crowbar is calculated on a per-hit basis, so extra attacks from total damage items do not account for its bonus damage, unless they also hit an enemy that is above 90% health.\nCrowbars, and similarly   Voidsent Flame, can become difficult to use in multiplayer or with damage-dealing allies, as they can reduce an enemy's health below 90% and prevent one from utilizing the damage increase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM CARGO BAY 5 OF UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\u201cHey, toss me a crowbar?\u201d\n\nJesse walked over to the toolbox and rummaged around. Plucking a crowbar from the container, she went over to James.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he grunted, attempting to pry the chest open. Jesse sat herself on the table next to James, idly watching him work. \u201cI swear, this had to be the one chest that CAN\u2019T be paid open... Crash must have... broken the circuitry inside.\u201d James mumbled to himself.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jesse looked around, her eyes falling on a palette of chests that had been recovered from the recent expeditions. Sighing, she hopped to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m heading to the mess hall. Want anything?\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, how about a better crowbar? This thing is only a second edition.\u201d James stretched, tossing the crowbar over his shoulder. Patting the still unopened chest, he chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s good, but to be honest\u2026 it\u2019s getting a little old.\u201d\n\nJesse laughed.\n\n\n== Version History ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Crowbar is a reference to the Half Life series created by Valve, in which the main character Gordon Freeman uses a crowbar similar to the one depicted as his melee weapon.\nThe text from the first game's logbook entry, \"until the 3rd edition arrives,\" as well as this game's updated entry adding that \"the second edition\" is \"getting a little old\" are digs at the long production time of the Half-Life series and Valve's seeming dislike of the number 3, going as far as making Half-Life 1, 2 and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2. Because of this, Half-Life 3 has become a well-known point of humor on the internet joking about how it will never come out.\nThe logbook entry may also be a reference to the Pok\u00e9mon anime, in which a pair of characters also named Jesse and James are thieves for the criminal organization known as Team Rocket. In the series, James is often found doing all the physical labor, while Jesse slacks off or raids the remaining food or supplies the duo have. They also consistently have little to no money in the series, reflected by how the pair are breaking into a chest whose payment mechanism is broken.",
