    "notes": "The Bundle of Fireworks is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the ...Maybe One More. Challenge.\nWhen interacting with something (with the exception of Scrappers), the player launches 8 (+4 per stack) homing fireworks, each exploding in a 5m radius and dealing 300% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.2.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nAfter interacting with something, fireworks rockets are launched one by one every 0.1 seconds, firing directly upwards.\nFireworks travel at 25 m/s, and accelerate at 2m/s.\nEach fireworks rocket stops homing in on enemies after 8 seconds and will fall to the ground. If the rocket still has not hit anything after 16 seconds, it automatically explodes.\nCritical chance is rolled upon activation. If the chance succeeds, all fireworks from that instance will deal critical damage.\nThe Bundle of Fireworks becomes substantially less useful with the Artifact of Sacrifice, since no Chests spawn.\nThis item cannot be obtained in the Simulacrum mode, and will appear locked if attempting to select it with the Artifact of Command.\nFireworks are affected by the  Pocket I.C.B.M.. Instead of launching 3 times as many rockets over a longer period, 3 rockets are launched at once every 0.1 seconds instead of the normal 1.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe vending machine spawned by  Remote Caffeinator allows for easy, repeated use of the Bundle of Fireworks and  Squid Polyp while in boss arenas or other areas which do not typically have interactables.\nOwing to its low proc coefficient, this item cannot reliably activate chance-based on-hit items like  Tri-Tip Dagger and  AtG Missile Mk. 1. To make the most out of this item, consider damage-increasing items that ignore proc coefficients entirely; these include  Lens-Maker's Glasses,  Delicate Watch,  Crowbar,  Armor-Piercing Rounds and  Brilliant Behemoth.\nSpecial mention goes to the  Plasma Shrimp, not only for its ability to ignore proc coefficients entirely, but also for being affected by the  Pocket I.C.B.M. as well. The amount of fireworks will be tripled, and each firework will proc three missiles on hit, leading to exponential damage returns.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Hey, happy anniversary!\n\nYou really thought I forgot?\n\nAh, I thought I was the dumb one in our relationship. C'mon T, of course not! Well, I wasn't going to let a little alien death planet ruin our night. Right? Shh, just watch. Just watch. It's okay. Just watch. You'll love it - you really will. Then we can go home.\n\nYou can keep your eyes closed. Just listen. Ah - here it comes! In five... four... three... two... ONE...!\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Lore Entry: Firework\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn the Risk of Rain universe, fireworks were banned on Earth after terrorists disguised missiles as fireworks. They were later re-legalized, in 2054.",
