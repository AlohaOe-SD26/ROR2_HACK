    "notes": "The Will-o'-the-wisp is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \n1 second after the holder kills an enemy, a fiery blast spawns where that enemy died. The blast has a 12m (+2.4m per stack) radius and deals 350% (+280% per stack) base damage. This damage suffers from sweet spot damage falloff.\nThe explosion has a proc coefficient of 1.0.\n\n\n== Math ==\n\n\n== Tips ==\nStacking both Will-o'-the-wisps and  Crowbars can allow the player to rapidly chain together kills against grouped enemies, or at the very least inflict heavy damage.\nThis is especially effective with the Artifact of Swarms enabled.\nUsing the Will-o'-the-wisp with the  Forgive Me Please allows the player to throw the doll at enemies for effective area damage.\nThe knock-back effect created from the explosion can scatter targets, which is not only useful for crowd control, but can also send light airborne targets like   Lesser Wisps and   Jellyfish crashing against terrain, dealing massive damage.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nAudio transcription complete from portable recorder.\n\nPrinting...\n\n\"You don\u2019t want to re-name it Bill-o-the-Wisp?\"\n\n\"NO.\"\n\n\"JAR-ed?\"\n\n\"NO.\"\n\n\"Then what about FLARE-ed?\"\n\n\"STOP.\"\n\n\"It needs a name, it\u2019s no dif-FIRE-ent than you or me.\"\n\n\"Next time we\u2019re at base I\u2019m applying for a transfer.\"\n\n\"You know that won\u2019t go through until at least Dec-EMBER.\"\n\n\"How long have you been waiting to use these?\"\n\n\"Coming up with them on the spot.
