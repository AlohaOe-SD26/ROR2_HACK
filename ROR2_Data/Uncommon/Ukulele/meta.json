    "notes": "The Ukulele is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen the holder hits an enemy, there is a 25% chance to create arcing chain lightning that hits up to 3 (+2 per stack) other targets within a 20m (+2m per stack) radius, dealing 80% total damage to each with a proc coefficient of 0.2. This chance to trigger is multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM RALLYPOINT [Redacted] --//\n\nThe planet was unforgiving, taking more and more with each passing day. Lives and limbs were lost, and the medical tent grew increasingly busy.\n\nJans was unfortunate enough to walk right into a group of Lemurians during a routine check around the rallypoint perimeter. He was lucky enough to escape with his life, but the Lemurians wounded his leg before backup arrived. \n\nJans leaned back in his cot. He strummed the strings on his ukulele \u2013 which he had picked up from an earlier expedition \u2013 as he contemplated his thoughts. Nothing too complex, but just a simple tune that he had picked up back when he took lessons as a child. Unbeknownst to him, one by one, he had gathered himself an audience. The gentle melodies of Jans\u2019 ukulele brought a rare comfort to the pained and labored patients, and for the first time since admittance, they felt like they could smile.\n\nLife in the medical tent was never something anybody could look forward to. Death, irreversible injuries, and a choking atmosphere surrounded them. But for a brief moment\u2026 the lives of those patients became that much brighter. Jans stopped, surveying the crowd intently watching him. \n\nHe laughed, readying himself for an encore. Maybe things wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Ukulele\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nQuality of Life\nUpdated the Ukulele model\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nDamage: 80% additive damage \u21d2 80% total damage\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item is iconic within Risk of Rain media;   Commando is often depicted with a Ukulele in artwork for both Risk of Rain games, and it is referenced in the   final boss's theme, which is titled \"You're Gonna Need a Bigger Ukulele.\"",
