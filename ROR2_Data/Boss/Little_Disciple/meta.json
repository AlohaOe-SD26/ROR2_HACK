    "notes": "The Little Disciple is a boss item introduced in the Scorched Acres Update, dropped by the   Grovetender. \nWhile the holder is sprinting, they periodically shoot homing wisps at enemies, dealing 300% (+300% per stack) damage per wisp. The speed at which the wisps are fired increases as movement speed increases.\nThe wisps have a range of 40m and a proc coefficient of 1.0.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe time in seconds between each fired wisp is determined by the formula 35 / (3 \u22c5 movementSpeed)\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item is most useful on Survivors that have the Agile keyword on their skills, such as   Huntress, allowing them to sprint constantly while using their skills and gain many bonus attacks from the Little Disciple.\nDespite their movement,   Engineer's   TR58 Carbonizer Turrets do not benefit from this item, as they are not sprinting.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nHELLO, LITTLE ONE.
