    "notes": "The Functional Coupler is a boss item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the  Alloyed Collective expansion and dropped by the   Solus Amalgamator.\nIt grants the user the ability to hold 1 (+1 per stack) additional equipment. The user can cycle through held equipment by pressing the interact and use equipment keys at the same time.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item functions somewhat similarly to   MUL-T's   Retool, which allows MUL-T to hold up to two different equipments.\nHowever, stacking this item allows the user to have an indefinite amount of equipment.\nThe item allows you to hold multiple aspects. For example, you can equip both  Ifrit's Distinction and  Silence Between Two Strikes, and swap between them to change your aspect on the fly.\nIf the player loses the item, all held equipment except the one in active use drops where they stand.\nAny dropped equipment will have their cooldowns reset.\nIf the player has a  Seed of Life in the extra equipment slot and not the main equipment slot, it will not revive the player if they die.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nConsider pairing an  Executive Card with a  Recycler to maximize item macro and get as many items as possible from Multishop Terminals, and re-rolling undesired items.\nThis item allows for more build diversity in runs; For example, you could stack  Bundle of Fireworks together with a  Remote Caffeinator for a firework build, while also stacking on-kill items with a  Forgive Me Please for a Forgive Me Please build.\nSince Firework builds work better with  Pocket I.C.B.M., this also opens the door for simultaneously equipping the  Disposable Missile Launcher. Prior to the Functional Coupler being added, this was only possible using   MUL-T's Retool.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n17809; DESIGN REQUEST RECOGNIZED \n\n17809; DESIGN OVERVIEW FOR STORED COUPLER: \n\n;SER ID> 028382164728648 \n\n;DESIGN> COUPLER \n\n;HIGHLIGHTS \n\n> \n\n> \n\n> SECURES FOREIGN UNITS AND INTEGRATES THEM INTO EXISTING ALGORITHMS \n\n> THEY ARE MINE \n\n> BYPASSES SUBROUTINES ON FOREIGN UNITS THAT WOULD PREVENT UNIFICATION \n\n> ALIGNS NEW UNITS WITH MASTER DIRECTIVE \n\n> ADAPTS NEW UNIT FUNCTIONALITY \n\n> THEY CAN NEVER LEAVE\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAlloyed Collective 1.4.1 Update Notes\nFunctional Coupler no longer drops all extra equipments when your items are disabled.\nAlloyed Collective\nAdded New Item: Functional Coupler",
