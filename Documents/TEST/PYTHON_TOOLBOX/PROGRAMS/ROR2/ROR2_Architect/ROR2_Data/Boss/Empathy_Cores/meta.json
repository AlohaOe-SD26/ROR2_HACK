    "notes": "The Empathy Cores are a boss item in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the   Solus Control Unit.  \nThey summon two friendly   Solus Probes, one colored red and one colored green, who will attack enemies near the player with a laser beam. Similarly to  Queen's Gland, these minions have stronger stats than their regular counterparts, with 4 times the health and a damage stat that increases by 100% (+100% per stack) per ally on the team, including each other but not their owner, starting their damage at 2x if all of them are alive. The Solus Probes are re-summoned every 30 seconds if they are destroyed and they only take 25% of damage dealt by AoE attacks due to a hidden +300 armor bonus against them. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nAllies include drones and turrets, other players, and minions spawned by items like  Queen's Gland, as well as ghosts spawned by  Happiest Mask. Essentially, every entity that appears on the column on the left side of the HUD.\nIf the Artifact of Swarms is active, four Probes will spawn instead of two, augmenting their damage output.\nThe Empathy Cores is one of the few blacklisted items that   Engineer's turrets will not inherit.\nWhen the   final boss steals the player's items, he will gain his own Probes and they will attack the player, dealing high damage.\nThis becomes even more dangerous if he steals multiple Empathy Cores or Queen's Glands, as the Probes will become extremely powerful.\n  Loader's   Spiked Fist can pull the Probes to her, although this will not damage them.\nThe Probes have collision, allowing players to stand on them. However, it may be difficult to remain there given how they move around when enemies are near.\nThe Probes will not respawn once the player has hit the ally limit of 16, making 14 allies the maximum amount that can be active at a time to ensure that the Probes can always be active. Acquiring yet another ally once the limit is reached (such as summoning a friendly   Aurelionite with a  Halcyon Seed) will not cause the Probes to despawn; however, if one of them dies then it will not respawn until the player has 15 or fewer allies again.\n Spare Drone Parts: Despite the probes not visually obtaining any augmentations, they will gain all of the buffs and chaingun granted by this item, and since   Col. Droneman is another ally, the damage it deals will get boosted as well.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n13006; PROBE CORE INSTANCE REQUEST RECOGNIZED\n\n13006; PROBE CORE INSTANCE OVERVIEW FOR STORED MODELS:\n\n;SER ID> 04534098130\n\n;INST> MINING PROBE INSTANCES\n\n;HIGHLIGHTS\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY BOLD AND GREEN AND LONELY\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY COLD AND RED AND LONELY\n\n13010; DOCKING CORES\n\n13011; DEPLOYED\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Boss Item: Empathy Cores\nAdded New Lore Entry: Empathy Cores\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nDespite using   Solus Probe's icon in-game (Wiki's icon is from WolfoQOL), each Probe has a unique design.\nThis item's name and the \"personalities\" of the Probes it summons (\"Quiet\" and \"Delighted\") may be a reference to the Personality Cores from the Portal series.\nThe colors of the Probes resemble that of The Twins boss from the game Terraria, a pair of colossal mechanical eyes that are also red and green.\nThe Probes are wrapped in cloth similar to that worn by the   Heretic, suggesting a possible link between the two.\nThis is especially intriguing given the Heretic's strong resemblance to an   Alloy Vulture, and the Alloy Vultures' relationship with the   Alloy Worship Unit.",
