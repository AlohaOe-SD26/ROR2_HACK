    "notes": "The Irradiant Pearl is a yellow item introduced in the Hidden Realms Update.\nIt can only be obtained from a Cleansing Pool in exchange for a lunar item, and increases all the holder's stats by 10% (+10% per stack).\nThe Irradiant Pearl has a drop rate of 20%. Its common counterpart is the  Pearl, which only increases the holder's health.\nWhen combined with both the scarcity of Cleansing Pools and the general unlikelihood of players having mass amounts of lunar items to trade, the Irradiant Pearl becomes one of the rarest items, if not the rarest item, in the game.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe  Recycler cannot be used to transform other boss items into an Irradiant Pearl, or vice versa.\nThough a Shrine of Order can be used to fulfill the same purpose.\nIrradiant Pearls cannot be obtained while the Artifact of Command is active. Cleansing Pools do not spawn, and neither the Pearl or the Irradiant Pearl can be selected from Yellow Command Essences.\nWhile Irradiant Pearls can be scrapped with a Scrapper for  Yellow Item Scraps and are the same rarity as other boss items, Yellow Scrap cannot be used with the Cleansing Pool, and Irradiant Pearls will never be offered by an Overgrown 3D Printer.\nIncreasing maximum health or regeneration is not considered healing, so picking up an Irradiant Pearl does not fail the Naturopath challenge.\nThe Irradiant Pearl only multiplies base armor, meaning it provides a maximum benefit of 2 armor on Survivors like   Loader, and gives no armor to Survivors without base armor.\nCorrection: The in-game description of adding 10% regeneration is incorrect; it actually increases regeneration by a flat 0.1 (+ 0.02 per level) HP/s per stack. This is effectively a 10% increase for most Survivors, except for   Loader,   Acrid, and the   Heretic.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOh, that is\u2026 strange. That is unlike the other pearls.\n\nDo not be mistaken \u2013 his influence is still dark. Despite how beautiful your pearl is\u2026 it is not from a place of kindness. It cannot be.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nQuality of Life\nCleansing Pool\nIrradiant Pearl Chance: 4% \u21d2 20%\nCan no longer be pinged to reveal its contents\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Irradiant Pearl\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Boss Item: Irradiant Pearl",
