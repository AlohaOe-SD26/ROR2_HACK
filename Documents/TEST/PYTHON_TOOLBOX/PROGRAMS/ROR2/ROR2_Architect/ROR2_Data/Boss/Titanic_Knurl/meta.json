    "notes": "The Titanic Knurl is a boss item in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the   Stone Titan.\nThe holder gains a flat +40 maximum HP (+40 HP per stack), and their natural health regeneration is increased by +1.6 HP/s (+1.6 HP/s per stack). Additionally, this regeneration bonus increases by 20% per player level, or 0.32 HP/s per level, per stack.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe regeneration provided by the Titanic Knurl benefits from the  Rejuvenation Rack.\nAs with other healing items which increase base health regeneration, picking up a Titanic Knurl does not inhibit the completion of the Naturopath challenge.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nLab Dissection Analysis File\n\nSubject: Titanic Knurl\n\nTechnician: C. Foreman\n\nTable Spec: Mineral Analysis BFC-5\n\nNotes: \n\n> From initial inspection, Knurl seems to be comprised of non-metallic substances. No marks are left when Knurl is r\ubbed against test surface.\n\n> We inspect hardness of Knurl. We managed to chip some of the Knurl away, showing us that the Knurl was tough but granular \u2013 individual fragments could be removed with little effort.\n\n> The fragment is moving. It appears to be trying to rejoin the mass.\n\n> Out of curiosity, I let it move freely. It slides along the table, up the knurl, and deposits itself back to its original position. The seam lines fade and the knurl is back as it had been minutes ago.\n\n> I test for magnetic properties in the rock. None are found.\n\n> Knurl\u2019s regenerative properties are documented, but are unexplainable at this moment.\n\n> Knurl is slowly moving off the table as I write this.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Titanic Knurl\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Titanic Knurl is the successor to the Colossal Knurl from Risk of Rain 1 item. The Colossal Knurl drops from the Stone Titan's predecessor, the Colossus, and increases the holder's health, health regeneration, and armor.\nDuring Early Access, prior to the introduction of the  Halcyon Seed, the Titanic Knurl would drop as a reward for defeating   Aurelionite in the Gilded Coast.",
