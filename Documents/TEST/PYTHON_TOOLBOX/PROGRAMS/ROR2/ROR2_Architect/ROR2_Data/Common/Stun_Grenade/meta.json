    "notes": "The Stun Grenade is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nOn hit, it gives a 5% (+5% per stack) chance to stun most non-boss enemies, interrupting most attacks and locking them in place for 2 seconds. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Stun Grenade is one of the few items in the game with hyperbolic stacking.\nThe chance to trigger is multiplied by the proc coefficient of the attack.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Commando can utilize the Stun Grenade well, since his primary   Double Tap deals rapid damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0. This also makes   Suppressive Fire irrelevant when it comes to stunning enemies, as Double Tap has no cooldown and should easily proc the Stun Grenade from time to time.\n  MUL-T can use the Stun Grenade similarly with   Auto-Nailgun, although this has a lower proc coefficient and much wider spread.\nStunning an enemy is not considered a debuff, and thus does not contribute towards  Death Mark.\nStunning an already stunned enemy resets the time stunned back to 2 seconds rather than stacking in overall duration.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe chance to activate is determined by the formula: f(x)=(1\u221210.05x+1)=0.05x0.05x+1\nWhere x is the amount.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM CARGO BAY 2 OF UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\u201cInventory duty. I swear, this must be the most boring position ever...\u201d Two crewmates stood in the cargo bay, doing a routine check on the items gathered from the Contact Light\u2019s wreckage. \u201cSome of us are out there having adventures and fighting aliens, and I\u2019M stuck in here counting dusty knick-knacks. What a bummer.\u201d The other crewmate idly tapped at their device as their colleague rummaged through a container of recovered items.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t agree there. The Contact Light had millions of items in transit... It\u2019s like a collage of people\u2019s interests from all across the galaxy.\u201d The other crew member scoffed. \u201cOh yeah? That\u2019s really inspiring. Say, keep telling those stories, maybe it\u2019ll make this go by quicker.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just need to look at this from a different angle. There\u2019s so much cool stuff in here! Like, for example...\u201d The worker took something out of a container \u2013 glancing over at their colleague, the other worker stiffened.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014is that a grenade!?\u201d \n\nThe worker laughed, tossing the dusty and dirty grenade from hand to hand. \u201cYeah. Don\u2019t worry, thing was damaged in the crash. See? Completely harmless.\u201d Holding the grenade up, a large dent was visible in its hull. \u201cMan, I wonder what kind of model this is... I was always super interested in like, weaponry and stuff. Hm... looks to be a flashbang... old model, they don\u2019t make these things anymore.\u201d \n\nThe other worker was not so thrilled. \u201cI still don\u2019t think you should play with that. That\u2019s not a toy.\u201d Squinting, the other worker realized in horror that the defunct grenade had no pin. \u201cD-DUDE! Put that thing down, there\u2019s no pin!\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? Oh, come on! Stop being such a buzzkill! This thing is busted beyond repair. It can\u2019t even detonate, not even if I were to say... bang it against this table. Watch, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\nThey were both admitted to the medical bay shortly after.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Stun Grenade\nGameplay Changes\nAdded visual effect when the item procs\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nChance to trigger now scales by proc coefficient\nFix Stun Grenade being able to stun certain characters with stun immunity (mainly survivors)\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nBug Fixes\nSet interrupt priority of frozen state to be higher than stun state to fix issues with the   Artificer   Snapfreeze being interrupted by Stun Grenades",
