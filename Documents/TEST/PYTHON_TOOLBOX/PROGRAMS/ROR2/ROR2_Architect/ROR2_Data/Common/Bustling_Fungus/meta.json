    "notes": "The Bustling Fungus is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \nAfter the holder remains stationary for 1 second, the item creates a radius of 3m (+1.5m per stack) which heals any ally within for 4.5% (+2.25% per stack) health every second, as long as the holder remains still. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The radius starts at 3.5m instead of 3m.\nThe fungus heals 4 times per second, for approximately 1.13% (+0.56%) health every tick.\nThe fungus's healing scales with the max health of the recipient, not the holder. It also can affect minions, such as drones,   Aurelionite,  Squid Turrets, and even ghosts from the  Happiest Mask. As a result, it can keep multiple turrets or ghosts alive despite their constant health drain and keep nearby minions healthy.\nHaving 177 Bustling Fungus will reach more than 100% healing (100.125%) per tick, which is effectively a soft cap without items using overhealing such as  Aegis. The  Rejuvenation Rack will greatly reduce the number needed to hit this cap (87 with only one Rack).\nThe effective healing radius is visible as a bright green circle around the holder, and green mushrooms of various sizes growing and disappearing. Any entity receiving healing inside the radius is also outlined in green.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Bustling Fungus is extremely powerful to stack as   Engineer (with his   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets), due to his turrets' ability to inherit his item inventory and their immobility. Each turret will automatically create a healing radius, sustaining not just itself but Engineer as well.\nThis strategy is particularly effective when combined with Engineer's   Bubble Shield.\n N'kuhana's Opinion is extremely powerful with this item, especially with the aforementioned Engineer strategy.\n  MUL-T can make excellent use of the Fungus while in   Power Mode, since the player's movement speed is already drastically reduced.\nThe bonus healing also further augments MUL-T's survivability, on top of the large armor bonus from Power Mode.\n  REX can rapidly fire   Seed Barrage while remaining stationary using the Fungus, quickly regaining the health lost from using the skill.\nThe Fungus's healing can easily offset the burning damage from the  Helfire Tincture, especially if the damage is reduced with  Repulsion Armor Plates.\nThe healing radius is placed at the holder's feet, or any ground straight below within 500m.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\u201cYou have a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? How? These are good for me, they\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, they help promote cell repair, carbon neutral, blah blah blah\u2026 I\u2019ve heard that spiel a thousand times already. Whether they\u2019re good for you or not, you can\u2019t just have a diet consisting only of them. It\u2019s basic dietary science!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what? Eating only mushrooms isn\u2019t healthy, just like eating only meat or vegetables isn\u2019t healthy!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re attacking vegetarians, now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWh- No! I just mean--\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, when you\u2019re a bit more tolerant of my lifestyle, I\u2019d be glad to continue this conversation with you. Until then, I\u2019d suggest you open your heart and appetite to a more\u2026 fungal\u2026 palette.\u201d\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Risk of Rain 2 community often refers to Bustling Fungus as \"Bungus\", a portmanteau of the two words.\nThe term gained such traction that the official Risk of Rain 2 Discord Server uses it for the Bustling Fungus emote.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Bustling Fungus\nGameplay Changes\nStart Delay: 2s \u21d2 1s\nNow heals at a higher tick rate - overall healing is the same, but the healing is smoother over time\n\ud83c\udf27 Now has small visual mushrooms that grow over the area\nQuality of Life\nUpdate visuals to match other assets",
