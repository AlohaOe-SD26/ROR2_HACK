    "notes": "Gasoline is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2.\nWhen the holder kills an enemy, it explodes in a burst of flame, dealing 150% damage to all enemies within 12m (+4m per stack) and   igniting them for 3 seconds (+1.5 seconds per stack), dealing 150% (+75% per stack) extra damage over the entire burn duration. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe in-game description is slightly misleading in that the damage dealt by the   ignite effect is not directly increased, only the duration of the effect is increased when additional stacks of Gasoline are acquired.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Forgive Me Please works well with this item, providing moderate damage over time in an area.\nWhile generally outclassed by the  Will-o'-the-wisp, both the Gasoline and the Will-o'-the-wisp can work together to provide reliable area of affect damage.\nIt is worth noting that Gasoline applies a debuff which contributes to  Death Mark, while Will-o'-the-wisp does not.\nThe blast radius for Gasoline increases at a greater rate with additional stacks than Will-o'-the-wisp and has no delay to dealing damage when it triggers, making this an effective item to clear large groups of enemies.\nGasoline's   ignite damage is increased by  Ignition Tank, while Will-o'-the-wisp is unaffected by it.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nAudio transcription complete from signal echoes. Assigning generic tokens.\n\n[Fire crackling]\n\nMAN 1: D-do you think they're gonna come for us?\n\nMAN 2: They'll try. It's going to be a very long while.\n\nMAN 1: What? Why?\n\nMAN 2: A long while. Even if they know where to look we'd be months out from the nearest port. And that's if they even have any ships as fast as ours \u2013 FTL ships are very rare nowadays.\n\nMAN 1: Months...?! And what do you mean if they know where? What about the other ships on our shipping routes?\n\nMAN 2: We weren't on the route.\n\n[Fire pops]\n\nMAN 1: What?!\n\nMAN 2: We should've been halfway to Procyon by the time we crashed... but we weren\u2019t. The ship never announced it was slowing down either, so that\u2019ll make triangulating our positions even harder.\n\nMAN 1: I-I don't get it. Who would take a UES train off course? That's completely insane!\n\nMAN 2: I don\u2019t know \u2013 only the Captain does. There\u2019s no reason to slow down in this star system - there's not even supposed to be a habitable planet out here.\n\n[Sizzling]\n\nMAN 2: This looks cooked to me. Can't vouch for how it'll taste - but we have to eat.\n\nMAN 1: I... I can't even think right now. I\u2019m not hungry.\n\nMAN 2: Eat. We've got a lot of traveling to do tomorrow and we'll need to keep our strength.\n\nMAN 1: Sure. Okay. Okay. Um\u2026 do you think it's poisonous?\n\nMAN 2: Eat.\n\nEnd of requested transcript. \n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\nNow deals 150% base damage on detonation alongside the burn effect\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nNow checks against hurtboxes in a sphere instead of against root-level character positions, resulting in it hitting more often\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Gasoline",
