    "notes": "The Backup Magazine is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Flawless Challenge.\nThe item grants the holder 1 extra charge (+1 per stack) of their secondary, or \"M2\" skill.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item is especially strong when used with characters with powerful and/or low-cooldown secondary skills.\nThis item increases the maximum amount of   Engineer's mines that can be placed.\nUnlike the  Hardlight Afterburner and  Lysate Cell, this item does not reduce the cooldown of the secondary skill.\nThe  Luminous Shot can instead be used to get a 20% cooldown reduction.\nHaving multiple Backup Magazines allows the player to quickly use multiple charges of their secondary skill back to back, and increased attack speed makes these multiple charges come out even faster. This burst potential is easier to obtain than reducing skill cooldowns to the minimum of 0.5 seconds through  Purity or  Brainstalks, although cooldown reduction is still effective for reloading the charges.\nThis item affects   MUL-T's secondary fire when in   Power Mode, although it can only be utilized by   Scrap Launcher.\nHowever, upon exiting Power Mode, all charges of   Blast Canister granted by Backup Magazines will be refreshed, turning the ability from largely a stun utility to a genuine source of damage with enough charges. Alternating between activating the skill and entering sprint to reset the animation will launch Blast Canisters more quickly.\nThis item lets   Railgunner fire additional consecutive shots while scoped in with   M99 Sniper before having to reload. However, with   HH44 Marksman, this item is functionally useless.\nThe   final boss utilizes Backup Magazines during Phase 4, which can work to the player's favor, as the self-damaging Lunar Orbs ability resides in his secondary slot; repeated uses will quickly reduce his health and return the player's items.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Ammo Magazine, Standard Ammunition (45mm Rounds)\n\nTracking Number: 05***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 10/05/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Priority\n\nShipping Address: Cargo Bay 10-C, Terminal 504-B, UES Port Trailing Comet\n\nShipping Details: \n\n- Billed to: Captain [REDACTED]\n\n- Note from Sender:  You going on a hunting trip or something? I\u2019ve never seen anyone order this much ammo before.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Backup Magazine\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nUpon picking up his first Backup Magazine,   Commando seems to attach it on the magazine of both of his guns.",
