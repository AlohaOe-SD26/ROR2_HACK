    "notes": "The Topaz Brooch is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhenever the holder kills a monster, they gain 15 barrier (+15 barrier per stack). \n\n\n== Notes ==\nBarriers do not grant one-shot protection, but also do not interact with HP-based one-shot protection.\nThe maximum amount of barrier obtainable is equal to the player's maximum health plus their maximum shields.\nThe  Forgive Me Please works somewhat well with this item, triggering the Topaz Brooch a total of 8 times per activation.\nBarrier depletes at a rate of 3.33% of the player's max health per second, but the Topaz Brooch grants a fixed amount of barrier per stack. High stacks of Topaz Brooches are required to keep the barrier sustained late-game.\nAs a result, the Topaz Brooch becomes generally outclassed by  Aegis once the player has enough healing items to sustain it, especially since many healing items do scale with the player's health.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Topaz Brooch\n\nTracking Number: 442*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 05/05/2056\n\nShipping Method: High Priority\n\nShipping Address: Locker #2, Parghos Resort, Venus\n\nShipping Details:\n\nThe locker combination is 33941. Inside the package, besides your standard equipment, you will find the brooch. The appearance of this item is meant to blend in at the party. Pin it to your body and the software inside will map your extents. Activation will briefly cover you in ultra-phasic shielding.\n\nWhen you have taken out the target, the shield will switch on to protect you from any immediate retaliation measures they have installed in the security system. If the time frame is not enough to make your escape, the shield can be... reactivated, but we\u2019d like to keep casualties to a minimum.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n== Placement ==\n\n\n=== Survivors ===\n  Commando places it on his chest, to the left.\n  Huntress places it on her chest, to the left.\n  Bandit places it on his hat, facing forwards.\n  MUL-T places it on its chest, to the left.\n  Engineer places it on his chest, a little to the left.\n  Artificer places it on her chest, to the left.\n  Mercenary places it on his chest, to the left.\n  REX places it centered on top of its lens.\n  Loader places it on her chest, to the left.\n  Acrid places it on its chest, to the right.\n  Captain places it on his chest, to the left.\n  Railgunner places it on her chest, to the right (normally obscured by her railgun's stock).\n  Void Fiend places it on its chest, to the right.\n  Seeker places it on her chest, to the left.\n  False Son places it on his chest, centered.\n  CHEF places it on the outside of its oven door, to the right.\n  Operator places it on the right side of his backpack.\n  Drifter places it on her chest, to the left.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Non-Playable Characters ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Topaz Brooch\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27\ufe0eBarrier Gain: 20(+20 per stack) \u21d2 15(+15 per stack)\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Item: Topaz Brooch",
