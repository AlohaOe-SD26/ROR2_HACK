    "notes": "The Focus Crystal is an item introduced in the Skills 2.0 Update.\nAll damage the holder deals to enemies within 13m is increased by 20% (+20% per stack), whether direct or indirect. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Focus Crystal's area of effect is indicated by a red ring on the ground around the holder.\nAll damage dealt by the Focus Crystal's holder is increased against nearby enemies, including damage-over-time effects such as {  Bleed.\nThe multiplier is applied to each hit individually, and total damage items are first calculated without the bonus. For example, assume that the player has 5 Focus Crystals and damages an enemy for 60 damage before accounting for the Focus Crystals. Assuming the enemy is within 13m of the player, the damage is boosted by 100% for 120 points. If this attack then activates an  AtG Missile Mk. 1, the missile will deal 300% of the base 60 damage, not the increased 120 damage, for a total of 180 damage. If the missile strikes an enemy within 13m of the player, it will then benefit from the Focus Crystals and deal an increased 360 damage.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nWhile this item is extremely powerful for melee Survivors who reliably fight close to enemies, all Survivors can expect at least some use out of this item.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Condensed Matter Crystal [50kg, 10cm by 10cm by 10cm]\n\nTracking Number: 12***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 05/23/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Standard\n\nShipping Address: Geofferson Principality, Highward, Titan\n\nShipping Details: \n\nHope they don\u2019t up the price for this thing. I haven\u2019t had troubles with UES before, but I\u2019ve never had to ship a crystal this far before. Let me know if the package is marked as \u201cheavy\u201d when you get it.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Focus Crystal\nGameplay Changes\nThe damage boost was changed from 15% (+15% per stack) \u21d2 20% (+20% per stack).\nNow shows radius for \u2018nearby\u2019 distance\nNow causes numbers to be pink when active  Developer Notes: There are many characters and builds where the Focus Crystal should shine through - however, it never seems to be quite high priority enough for the effort required. We\u2019re hoping that by making it both flashier and stronger, players will prioritize it.\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nNew Item: Focus Crystal\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
