    "notes": "The Monster Tooth is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen the holder kills an enemy, a healing orb spawns where that enemy died, which heals the player for 8 HP plus an additional 2% (+2% per stack) of their maximum health when collected. The orbs last for roughly 10 seconds each, and will blink when about to expire. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe player must approach the orbs to pick them up, although the orbs will automatically come to the player at a short distance.\nThis item is much stronger on melee Survivors, since the player will always be close to the enemies they defeat.\nObtaining 50 stacks of Monster Teeth grants 100% healing per orb. This is reduced with  Rejuvenation Racks; having one Rack requires half as many Monster Teeth (25), having two Racks requires a third as many (17), so on and so forth.\nThe Forgive Me Please works well with this item, since it will spawn the orbs 8 times while in its duration. The player must take care to throw the doll somewhere nearby, though, or else the orbs will be wasted.\nEach stack increases the size of the healing orbs slightly, although this change is barely noticable at lower stack amounts\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM ROOM 5041C OF UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\u201cHey, nice duds! Where\u2019d you grab those?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, this old thing? I\u2019ve been making it, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I found the first tooth in one of the chests. But every time we go out on patrol, we typically run into more of those aliens. Once we take care of \u2018em, I try to pick myself out a souvenir. Y\u2019know, to add to my collection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, uh\u2026 Is that like, allowed? I feel like that\u2019s not allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, what the captain doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him. Besides, it IS cool, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess so. I\u2019ll be honest man, that\u2019s creepy as hell\u2026 but hey, do you have any more string? I might start one of my own.\u201d\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Monster Tooth\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nHealing: 8 (+8 per stack) \u21d2 8\n\ud83c\udf27Now also heals for 2% (+2% per stack) of maximum health\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4233443)\nGameplay Changes\nHeal: 6 \u21d2 8\nNow that we're encouraging players to value healing items more, the healing items themselves should be a bit more decent\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nHealing Orb: 4 (+4 per stack) \u21d2 6 (+6 per stack)\nQOL\n\u2602 Updated the packs from Monster Tooth to flash before despawning\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3703355)\nBug Fixes\nMonster Tooth: The Monster Tooth healing orbs heal amount now match the description.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn Risk of Rain 1, Monster Tooth orbs would automatically come to the player from any distance.\nUnlike its earlier counterpart, the Monster Tooth in Risk of Rain 2 is actually a necklace of multiple teeth.",
