    "notes": "The Hiker's Boots are an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Alloyed Collective expansion.\nWhen the player strikes an enemy below them, the item grants a buff that increases the player's critical strike chance and critical strike damage by 1% (+1% per stack), up to a maximum of 10 times. The effect lasts 10 seconds, and dealing any damage with a proc coefficient, regardless of elevation, refreshes the 10s duration. The buff will only be applied once in a proc chain.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description does not specify the buff's duration resetting upon damaging enemies.\nThe buff's duration will be reset even if the player is below the enemy.\nThe item triggers when the attacker\u2019s center is at least one radius (\u2248 half their height) above the target\u2019s center, meaning the attacker\u2019s feet only need to reach roughly the target\u2019s mid-body to activate the bonus.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n Hopoo Feather,  Faraday Spur, and  H3AD-5T v2 synergize very well with this item, allowing a consistent way to get above most enemies.\nAt 10 stacks or more of Hiker's Boots, you can reach 100% critical strike chance. Given this,  Lost Seer's Lenses are more appealing with Hiker's Boots, as  Lens-Maker's Glasses are no longer required to guarantee critical strikes.\nCertain survivors will benefit greatly from this item, as they have ways to consistently stay above their enemies.\n  Artificer's   Ion Surge combined with   ENV Suit.\n  Mercenary can chain his skills together to stay in the air, along with his natural double jump.\n  Operator's   Ascent Protocol with enough drones.\nDue to   Railgunner's   Magnetic Accelerator, her critical strike damage will increase by 2% (+2% per item stack) per stack of the buff.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Altitude-Safety Hiking Boots \n\nTracking Number: 05015*********** \n\nEstimated Delivery: 04/13/2056 \n\nShipping Method:  Standard \n\nShipping Address: Mountain Outpost 041-C, Nepal, Earth \n\nShipping Details: \n\nGrabbed these boots from the market. Seller claimed the boots have implants that maintain focus at high altitudes - perfect for your thrill-seeking lifestyle, eh? Gimme a write-back and let me know how they work, or I'll bill you for the 20 bucks I spent on these things.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate 1.4.1\nItem now always adds buff, instead of being 100% chance multipled by proc coeff\nAlloyed Collective\nAdded New Item: Hiker's Boots",
