    "notes": "Chronic Expansion is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nEvery enemy killed grants a   buff that increases damage by 3.5% (+1% per stack) and lasts for 7 seconds. The buff can be stacked up to 10 times (+5 per stack). Dealing damage resets the buff's duration.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe item displays a bright red counter on the player's body.
