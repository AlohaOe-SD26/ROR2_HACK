    "notes": "The Spinel Tonic is a lunar equipment introduced in the Scorched Acres Update. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Cosmic Explorer Challenge.\nActivating the Tonic will   dramatically increase all the player's stats for 20 seconds, but after this buff wears off there is a 20% chance to gain a  Tonic Affliction; the affliction reduces all stats by 5% (-5% per stack) if the player is not under the Tonic's buff. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nWhile the   Tonic Buff is active, the in-game character model emits dark bursts of liquid, the screen becomes tinted blue, and the camera's FOV increases.\nThe stat bonuses (other than armor) for this buff are unique in that they are multipliers. For example, not only does the attack speed buff give 70% bonus attack speed, it makes all other attack speed buffs 70% stronger, so a  Soldier's Syringe would give 25.5% bonus attack speed instead of the normal 15%.\nThe chance to get a  Tonic Affliction is affected by Luck. This means that with a single  57 Leaf Clover, the player's chance to get an affliction is reduced to 4%. However, having a single  Purity instead will increase the affliction chance to 36%.\nHaving enough Tonic Afflictions can reduce a survivor's maximum health to 1 HP. Unlike  Shaped Glass, further stacks do not kill the player.\nThe chance to acquire an affliction is determined when the Spinel Tonic is activated.\nThe Tonic Afflictions are not given to the player until the tonic buff wears off, meaning that if the equipment is activated multiple times and then the tonic buff ends, multiple stacks of Tonic Affliction can be gained at once.\nThis can be avoided by advancing to the next stage, which removes the tonic buff without giving any Tonic Afflictions.\nThe Tonic Affliction is added directly to the player's inventory.\nTonic Afflictions can be avoided if the buff is kept up continually, and all afflictions have their effects negated while the buff is active.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe +300% regeneration applies to  Cautious Slug,  Titanic Knurl, and   Acrid's Regenerative buff, making them all 4 times as powerful.\nExtremely powerful when paired with the  War Horn, as it's 70% attack speed buff becomes 119%, and if you have 4  War Horns the attack speed buff will last for the entire duration of the tonic.\nThis equipment is not as effective when playing as   Engineer, as his turrets are not affected by the buff but still inherit all of his afflictions.\nUsing the Tonic as the   Heretic will quickly lead to her death, since it quadruples her negative health regeneration.\nPairing this with the  Transcendence allows the Heretic to use the Tonic, since it sets her regeneration to 0. This comes at the cost of being unable to heal normally, however.\nIt's possible to gain permanent uptime and avoid the buff wearing off by having a  Gesture of the Drowned and at least 3  Fuel Cells.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe Tonic Affliction debuff will reduce a victim's HP by 1 - 1 / ( 1 + 0.1 \u22c5 amount of afflictions)\nAll other stats are reduced by 1 - 0.95 ^ amount of afflictions\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cReality is whatever the mind decides it to be. Take a sip of the drink, and the mind becomes malleable. From there, you can shape it into whatever form you please... and the world around you follows your example.\u201d\n\n- Sigibold the Drunken\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Spinel Tonic\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nBug Fixes\nFix description of Spinel Tonic incorrectly providing the effect duration as 15 seconds instead of the 20 seconds it is in-game\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3961583)\nBug Fixes\nFix Tonic Affliction reducing maximum health and also applying curse health reduction on top of it\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Lunar Equipment: Spinel Tonic\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nBefore the Skills 2.0 update, using a Shrine of Order would remove all Tonic Afflictions from a character.",
