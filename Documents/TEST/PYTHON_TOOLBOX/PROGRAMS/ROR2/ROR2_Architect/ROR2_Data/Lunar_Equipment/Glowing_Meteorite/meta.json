    "notes": "The Glowing Meteorite is a returning equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Moon Worshipper Challenge.\nWhen activated, the world darkens for 20 seconds and \"meteors\" rain down, hurting all characters indiscriminately. Glowing blue rings indicate where the meteors will strike, giving players a chance to navigate through them safely (although the random nature of the strikes means that damage is sometimes unavoidable).  \nEach meteorite deals 600% damage to both players and monsters with a proc coefficient of 1.0, suffering from linear damage falloff. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nNo actual projectiles are created by the Glowing Meteorite; instead, the game simply places explosions on the ground near characters. This means that explosions will still spawn inside caves or under ceilings, and  Defensive Microbots cannot protect the player from meteors.\nWhen activating the Teleporter, since monster spawns are concentrated inside the Teleporter's radius, nearly all the meteors will fall inside or near the Teleporter.\nMultiple uses of the Glowing Meteorite (with  Fuel Cells or sufficient cooldown reduction) stack, causing more meteors to fall.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Artificer's   ENV Suit makes her jumps much more floaty than other characters', making dodging meteor strikes easier; a full-height jump followed by a hover can easily avoid most meteor strikes that don't land directly on top of her.\nFor extra security, Artificer can use   Ion Surge to fly high above the ground, allowing her to rain down destruction with impunity.\nThe  Strides of Heresy can help the player dodge meteor strikes and recover any HP they may have lost. This becomes especially effective when stacking the Strides, enabling the player to spend large amounts of time invulnerable while the meteors fall.\nThe  Soulbound Catalyst is particularly effective at recharging the Glowing Meteorite's cooldown, as any kill scored by the meteors will instantly reduce its cooldown. Given the high damage of the meteors and the fact that they attack all across the map, just a single use of the Glowing Meteorite will be almost sure to score several kills.\nIf the player is confident in their ability to navigate the meteors, giving the Glowing Meteorite to an   Equipment Drone can devastate enemies easily. Due to the Equipment Drone's large cooldown reduction, it will automatically use the Meteorite approximately every 28 seconds. This strategy becomes progressively more dangerous as the run goes on, however, since Equipment Drones use the ambient run level and not the player's level.\nFor reference, an Equipment Drone has the same base damage stat as a   Brass Contraption, and each meteor strike inflicts more damage than a single Brass Contraption spike ball (600% versus 500%). In long runs, dying to the Equipment Drone becomes a very real possibility as its stats increase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nWhat a... peculiar piece of the stars that serendipity has brought us. I'm sure you can make more. The ratios are simple. It should be quite fun.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Glowing Meteorite\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Glowing Meteorite is (currently) the only returning equipment from Risk of Rain 1 that was changed from a regular equipment to a lunar equipment.\nUsing this equipment in multiplayer can be detrimental to other players without movement options, especially on smaller environments.",
