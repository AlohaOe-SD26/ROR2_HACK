    "notes": "Polylute is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void update.\nWhen the holder hits an enemy, there is a 25% chance to create a blast of void energy targeting that enemy. This blast will hit 3 times (+3 per stack), with each hit dealing 60% total damage, for a total of 180% (+180% per stack) damage.\nThis item is the void variant of the  Ukulele. When this is picked up, all stacks of Ukuleles will be converted into an equal number of Polylute stacks. In addition, all future Ukuleles picked up will be immediately converted into more Polylutes.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Polylute has a proc coefficient of 0.2, like the  Ukulele.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Polylute is in theory similar in power to Ukulele. Ukulele applies TOTAL\u00d780% on 3 other targets, while Polylute applies TOTAL\u00d760% on the same target 3 times. While losing the area-of-effect of Ukulele seems to be significant, Polylute allows the holder to kill the original target much faster and then turn their attention to other enemies.\nHowever, the Polylute supersedes the Ukulele in power when there are 2 or fewer enemies near the original target. This makes the item extremely valuable over its original counterpart against the final bosses;   Mithrix,   Voidling,   False Son, and   Solus Heart.\nIt is worth noting that unlike Ukulele, Polylute cannot be used at the Wandering CHEF, potentially locking the user out of certain recipes, notably the ones for  Sentient Meat Hook,  Unstable Tesla Coil, and  Electric Boomerang.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nWelcome to DataScraper (v3.1.53 \u2013 beta branch)\n$ Scraping memory... done.\n$ Resolving... done.\n$ Combing for relevant data... done.\nComplete!\n\nI've made a fas---ating discove-y!
