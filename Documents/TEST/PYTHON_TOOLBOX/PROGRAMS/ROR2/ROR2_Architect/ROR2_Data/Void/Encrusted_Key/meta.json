    "notes": "The Encrusted Key is a void item added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corrupted version of the  Rusted Key.\nWith this item in the player's possession, an Encrusted Cache resembling a small purple sphere will spawn somewhere on the map when teleporting in. Interacting with this cache will consume an Encrusted Key and drops a Void Potential orb, allowing the player to choose between three void items (41.66%/41.66%/16.66%).\nThis chance is affected by the drop chance bias and as a result uncommon options are more likely and legendary options are much less likely than expected. The effective chance is (42.37%/50.84%/6.79%).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of (60%/30%/10%) is incorrect.\nAs void items do not have a discernible rarity and all fall under the same umbrella of void, their \"rarity\" as considered for the cache's drop chances is the rarity of the uncorrupted counterparts (e.g. the  Needletick is the corruption of the  Tri-Tip Dagger, a white item, and so the Needletick is considered a \"white\" void item).\nVoid caches will spawn even if the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled.\nIf the Artifact of Command is active, the void cache rarity will always be common.\nThe Encrusted Key will only corrupt other Rusted Keys while at least 1 Encrusted Key is in the player's inventory. Consuming an Encrusted Key will remove it from the player\u2019s inventory, thereby preventing future Rusted Keys from becoming corrupted. This is the only void item that can be removed from a player\u2019s inventory.\nIn multiplayer, a cache is spawned for each player holding an Encrusted Key.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nSince the void cache itself can contain an Encrusted Key, the player can choose to take it and get a new void item on the next stage if neither of the other 2 options were desirable.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"I have this key. I found it one day when I was taking a walk along the beach... It was washed up on the shore, all covered in crust and sand. I dunno why, but I took it with me... I figured it would be neat to try and figure out what this key went to. It'd be like a treasure hunt, y'know? Thing is, no matter who I went to, I never found anything. Any lock that seemed to match, the key wouldn't go in all the way. I was starting to get frustrated. I... I'm not too religious, but for some reason, I felt it was my destiny to use this old, beat-up key and find its match. M-Maybe it would change my life. I dunno. And, when I heard about this mission, for some reason, my heart began to race. I've heard all about the Contact Light's disappearance, everyone has. But... I don't know why, but I felt, in my heart of hearts... Whatever this key went to was where the Contact Light was. And it was my destiny to come along.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Encrusted Key",
