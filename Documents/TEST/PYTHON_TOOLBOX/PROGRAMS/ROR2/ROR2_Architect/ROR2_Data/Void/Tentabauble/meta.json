    "notes": "The Tentabauble is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of the  Chronobauble. \nOn hit, the item gives a 5% (+5% per stack) chance to inflict {  Nullified on the target for 1 second (+1 second per stack), reducing their movement speed to 0. The chance to Nullify a target is multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nJust because an enemy is Nullified does not mean it cannot move at all; flying enemies can still ascend and descend, and other modes of movement such as the   Parent's teleportation still function normally.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nWhile {  Nullified targets may help players immobilize enemies, the loss of guaranteed {  slow from the  Chronobauble can make activating  Death Mark more challenging without more stacks of Tentabauble.\nLike most status conditions, the   Mithrix is not immune to the Nullified status. With enough stacks or a high fire rate, it is possible to lock him in place repeatedly.\nNote that his dash skill cures all his debuffs and can be used even when Nullified, giving him a way to break free.\nAlthough the Tentabauble's chance to Nullify an enemy is hyperbolic, the increased duration means that it can still see increasing returns, not diminishing, with high stacks.\nThis is in stark contrast to the Chronobauble, which is generally useless past the first stack.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe base chance to Nullify a target can be found with 1 - 1 / (1 + 0.05 \u22c5 amount)\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Mobile Terrarium + Chronobauble\n\nTracking Number: 99******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 03/03/2076\n\nShipping Method: Biological\n\nShipping Address: 9042 Pvt. Drive, Yustik Plaza, Mercury\n\nShipping Details:\n\nHey, me in the past. This'll sound really corny, but I've been really into gardening lately. Now, before you say anything, you gotta think about the situation I'm in. I mean, with all the stuff going on, anyone would go nuts if they had to deal with - oops. No spoilers, my bad.\n\nAnyway, remember that chronobauble? The one we found on Mercury? Turns out, it has a \"fast-forward\" feature. I, um, tried to use it to help some hybrids I was growing mature faster. Botany stuff, you'll get it later - well, I may have made it go a bit too fast. This thing must've gone through a few millennia by the time I turned the dial back to 0. I'm pretty sure this is like, an entirely new genus of plant? Maybe even an entirely separate species. Note to self: remember to never turn the dial up to 11. You WILL create an abomination of evolution.\n\nAnyways, same drill as last time - shipping this to myself in 10 years. 10 years passes quickly, especially if it's contained within a locally accelerated temporal field. Yeah, it'll go by in the blink of an eye - alongside a couple millenia! Maybe I should take up scrapbooking next.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Tentabauble\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item's logbook entry is a continuation of the events in the Chronobauble's log.",
