    "notes": "The Lysate Cell is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of the  Fuel Cell.\nThe holder gets 1 extra charge (+1 per stack) of their special skill, and the cooldown of their special skill is reduced by 33%.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description does not mention the special skill cooldown reduction.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item allows   Engineer to have three turrets placed simultaneously. Additional stacks of this item further increases the number of charges, but will not allow more than three turrets to be placed at once.\nThis item gives   Captain an additional charge of his (primary) left beacon which can be used as many times as the player holds Lysate cells, however, the amount of beacons that can be present on stage is still limited to 2, meaning the oldest beacon will be despawned.\nWhile Lysate Cell will allow   Void Fiend to use   Corrupted Suppress more than usual, it has no effect while Void Fiend is uncorrupted, since   Suppress can already be used an infinite number of times with no cooldown (as long as Void Fiend has enough corruption to spend).\nExtra charges of   Drifter's   Salvage and   Tinker skills can't be used without collecting more Junk first.\nSince the Fuel Cell has poor synergy with any equipment that does not benefit from extra charges or cooldowns (such as Elite equipment and the  Executive Card), the player can take a Lysate Cell without any negative effect on their equipment.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Recycling is an important thing. And I don't mean recycling a glass bottle to help the environment - though that's important too! No, by 'recycling,' I mean taking one thing, and using it for another. For example, my Ukelele. I love this thing. It has electric properties, and passes them on to my attacks - free chain lightning! But what if I were to 'recycle' it? I think the Uke would make a pretty good melee weapon. Imagine, bludgeoning a Lemurian and pumping it full of volts, in one easy step.\n\nDo you get what I'm saying? There's opportunities for recycling all over the place. You just need to open your mind to the possibilities, and see... And do a little recycling. It's good for the environment.\"\n\n- Lost Journal, recovered from Petrichor V\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Lysate Cell\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nA lysate is a substance that induces lysis in cells, i.e. cell death through the disintegration of the cell wall/membrane. It may be intentionally ironic that the Lysate Cell contains a cell-destroying substance yet is a \"cell\" itself.",
