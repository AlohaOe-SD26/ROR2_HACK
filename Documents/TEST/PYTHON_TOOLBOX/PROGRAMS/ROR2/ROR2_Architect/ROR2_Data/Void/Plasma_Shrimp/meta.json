    "notes": "The Plasma Shrimp is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of the  AtG Missile Mk. 1. \nOn hitting an enemy, if the player has any shield, they will launch a homing missile that deals 40% (+40% per stack) total damage with a proc coefficient of 0.2. In addition, the first Plasma Shrimp the player acquires gives shield equal to 10% of their maximum health.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of +50% total damage per stack is incorrect.\nHaving any number of Plasma Shrimps will make the shield bar pink, instead of the normal blue color. This includes other shield sources such as  Personal Shield Generator and  Transcendence.\nShields cannot be healed by conventional means, and will only replenish after avoiding damage for 7 seconds.\nThe shield gained from the Plasma Shrimp is affected by anything that modifies the holder's maximum health, such as the  Shaped Glass and  Stone Flux Pauldron: when the player's maximum health is modified, the amount of shields they gain is increased or reduced by the same amount.\nThe missiles fired by Plasma Shrimp act differently than every other missile in the game, rapidly homing on the target while ignoring other enemies and terrain. If the original target dies, missiles will not search for a new target.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAny damage with a proc coefficient greater than 0.0 triggers the Plasma Shrimp. This makes attacks with lower coefficients very effective, since it effectively increases the proc coefficient of them by 0.2.\nThe Plasma Shrimp can be especially useful on skills that can quickly fire multiple projectiles, such as   Bandit's   Burst, as well as skills with relatively high attack speed, such as   MUL-T's   Auto-Nailgun.\nThis is notably effective with many items that have low proc coefficients.  Visions of Heresy always triggers Plasma Shrimp twice per shot- once for the initial 0.1 hit, and once for the delayed 1.0 hit,  Ukulele & it's void counterpart  Polylute are both notable because they hit multiple times and each individual hit always procs a Plasma Shrimp with their 0.2 proc coefficient.\nIt's worth noting that Plasma Shrimp activates on-hit items more frequently and quickly than  AtG Missile Mk. 1, but comes at the cost of dealing less damage from TOTAL damage items such as  Ukulele.\nHaving the  Transcendence (or, more rarely, the  Shared Design) will turn the player's entire health bar into shields. This makes the Plasma Shrimp always active, granting a consistent increase in damage output.\nThe  Pocket I.C.B.M. triples the projectiles fired by the Plasma Shrimp, drastically increasing its damage and number of on-hit procs.\nRemoving the luck-based element of the  AtG Missile Mk. 1 allows a player to use the Plasma Shrimp without being affected by the downside of  Purity. However, if they have increased luck, the Plasma Shrimp can potentially become a damage loss.\nAt one  57 Leaf Clover,  AtG Missile Mk. 1 deals more damage on average if the triggering Proc Coefficient is 0.7 or better. With two stacks of  57 Leaf Clover, AtG Missile wins out if triggering Proc Coefficient is as low as 0.5; any lower than this, and Shrimp Missile is still productive. These numbers don't necessarily apply to activating on-hit effects. This theory does not account for increased stacks of AtG Missile Mk. 1s which has more single damage potential than Plasma Shrimp.\nIt's important to note that should you have a  Polylute, Plasma Shrimp is going to be resulting in more damage in nearly every scenario, regardless of how many  57 Leaf Clover you have. Polylute hitting an enemy multiple times pairs extremely well with Plasma Shrimp as mentioned before, and with more clovers, Polylute will trigger more often, resulting in more extra damage from Plasma Shrimp.\nAlthough the Plasma Shrimp is more effective at stacking status effects on enemies than the AtG Missile Mk. 1 in nearly all cases (since it adds +0.2 proc coefficient while the AtG adds 10% of the original), its low proc coefficient means that the extra stacks inflicted will have extremely low duration. However, this is still useful for attacks that have a low proc coefficient themselves.\nNotably, because stacks of   Bleed from the  Tri-Tip Dagger and  Shatterspleen are refreshed when a higher-duration stack is inflicted, the extra stacks of Bleed from the Plasma Shrimp can be reset repeatedly.\nIt is worth noting that unlike the  AtG Missile Mk. 1, Plasma Shrimp cannot be used at the Wandering CHEF, potentially locking the user out of the recipes for  Runic Lens,  Pocket I.C.B.M.,  Disposable Missile Launcher,  Molten Perforator and  Charged Perforator. This has the added effect of making  Saut\u00e9ed Worms significantly harder to obtain.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"I believe there is a benefit to attacking from behind an impenetrable defense. Some may call it cheating, they may call you a coward, even... I call them targets.
