    "notes": "The Weeping Fungus is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corrupted version of  Bustling Fungus.\nWhile the holder sprints, the item grants the   Weeping Fungus Regeneration buff, which heals the holder for 2% (+2% per stack) of their maximum health per second.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe fungus heals 2 times per second, for 1% (+1%) health every tick.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nWeeping Fungus is stronger on Survivors who have the Agile keyword on their skills, such as   Huntress and   Mercenary.\nAlthough   Power-Saw doesn\u2019t count as an Agile ability, it can still be used while sprinting.\nConversely,   Engineer may want to avoid Weeping Fungus when using his   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets, as they are unable to trigger the item due to being stationary. However, it does provide strong healing to Engineer himself.\nAlthough the Weeping Fungus may seem like a perfect fit for the   TR58 Carbonizer Turret, turrets never sprint unless there is an extremely long distance between them and Engineer, making this item only effective on Engineer himself.\n  Void Fiend will have difficulty transforming into its corrupted form with this item. Two stacks of Weeping Fungus provides enough healing to effectively lock Void Fiend in his uncorrupted form.\nWeeping Fungus is particularly effective in Simulacrum as it allows the player to withstand some of the suffocation effects of Void Fog.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"This sucks.\"\n\n\"You know, you could have something to eat if you just said the magic word...\"\n\n\"No! I'm not having one of those $#@!ing mushrooms!\"\n\n\"C'mon, they're harmless. In fact, better than harmless, they're--\"\n\n\"Don't even start. And we don't even know that, remember how you got an infection after you first tried them!?\"\n\n\"Common head cold.\"\n\n\"Whatever. My point being, those things probably changed your digestive tract so you could eat them, or some weird $#!& like that. I'm not stooping to your level!\"\n\n\"Well, you're more than welcome to ride your high road with THEM, Mr. Picky Eater. Or, you could stay in the safety of this little cave, and share a snack with me.\"\n\n\"I... I'd rather--\"\n\nROAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!\n\n\"...Oh my god, fine. Hand it over.\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Weeping Fungus\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nSimilar to the Bustling Fungus, the Risk of Rain 2 community sometimes refers to Weeping Fungus as \"Wungus.\"",
