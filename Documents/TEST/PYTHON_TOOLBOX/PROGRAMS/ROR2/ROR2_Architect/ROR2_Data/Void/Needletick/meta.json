    "notes": "The Needletick is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corrupted version of the  Tri-Tip Dagger. \nOn hit, it gives a 10% (+10% per stack) chance to inflict   Collapse on the target (which is multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient). 3 seconds after Collapse is first applied to a target, the effect will trigger, removing all stacks of Collapse on the target and dealing 400% damage per stack removed.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n  Bleed effects from  Noxious Thorn and  Shatterspleen will not be replaced by Collapse.\nEnemies inflicted with Collapse have a pulsing red circle displayed on top of them, which grows in size and flashes more vigorously when Collapse is about to deal damage.\nIf an enemy dies before Collapse deals damage, the circle will remain at the position where it died.\nBecause Collapse is of type Damage over Time, the damage dealt has a proc coefficient of 0.0.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nNoxious Thorn and Shatterspleen can still be used to apply bleed if Tri-Tip Daggers are corrupted, effectively allowing for both debuffs from Tri-Tip Daggers and Needleticks to apply simultaneously.\nTri-Tip and Shatterspleen do not apply two separate stacks of bleed making Tri-Tip daggers obsolete if players have enough crit chance for Shatterspleen. If players have Shatterspleen, it would be prudent to get Needleticks to get both Collapse and Bleed on hit.\nOne stack of Bleed deals a total of 240% base damage over 3 seconds, while one stack of Collapse deals 400% base damage after 3 seconds. All stacks of Bleed have their durations refreshed when an additional new stack is inflicted, while all Collapse stacks expire at once after the 3-second countdown begins.\nAs a result, if the player has enough Tri-Tip Daggers and hit rate to repeatedly reset Bleed stacks, Bleed will outperform Collapse, especially in long fights. However, the Needletick is still useful at low stacks when resetting Bleed would be unlikely, or for Survivors with very low hit rate.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nWelcome to DataScraper (v3.1.53 \u2013 beta branch)\n$ Scraping memory... done.\n$ Resolving... done.\n$ Combing for relevant data... done.\nComplete\n\nThe following has been flagged as evidence for use in the trial of Titan v.
