    "notes": "The Mercurial Rachis is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2, added in Content Update 5.\nThe item randomly places a ward near the holder that gives the {  Power Buff status to any character within 16m (+50% per stack), increasing their damage by 50%. The character is powered up regardless of whether they are an ally or enemy. The ward lasts for roughly 27 seconds and will take another second to replace itself near the holder.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Power Buff status only persists as long as the character stays in the ward's radius. It expires almost immediately when the character leaves the radius, or if the ward expires.\nThe ward has a radius indicating its area of effect, similar to the  Focus Crystal, but its actual area of effect is slightly smaller than the indicator.\nWhile the ward's placement is somewhat random,   Engineer can utilize this item very well if his   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets are in the ward's radius.\nEngineer's turrets will also place nearby wards.\nBe aware of how large the ward's radius becomes when stacking this item. While increasing the radius gives the player more freedom to move around within, excessive stacks will make it much more likely for enemies to become powered up as well.\nUnlike  Warbanner, the Radius increases by 50% of the previous stacks radius, making each stack increase the radius further than the last.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cThe original information super-highway: the spine. A strait-laced path from the body to the brain, it is responsible for ensuring the survival of all life. However, its limitations involve being localized to its parent body. What if - just like the development of the inter-computer wireless network - one\u2019s nervous system could communicate with another? What if the spine traced a path not just from body to mind, but a path that intersects between other bodies and minds?\u201d\n\n- Notes of Job Michaels, Serial Killer and Mad Scientist\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Mercurial Rachis\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nNew Lunar Item: Mercurial Rachis\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
