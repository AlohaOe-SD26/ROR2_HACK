    "notes": "The Defiant Gouge is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhenever the holder activates a Shrine or Cleansing Pool, the Defiant Gouge summons enemies (more enemies per stack), much like a Shrine of Combat would. Shrines that can be activated multiple times will spawn enemies for each activation.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nStacking this item will cause the summoned enemies to be more powerful and/or numerous, as though the difficulty were higher. This also means that those enemies are worth more gold and EXP when they die.\nIf playing with the Artifact of Sacrifice, this item can be used to acquire items more easily, as higher difficulty enemies also have higher chances to drop items. However this strategy is inherently limited by the amount of shrines one can find in any given stage.\nJust like Shrines of Combat, the difficulty scaling of the enemies spawned by this item is based on the difficulty when the player enters the level, not when the shrine is activated.\nBe careful when trying to get rid of this item through a Cleansing Pool while having multiple stacks or multiple lunar items, as every use that doesn't entirely remove this item will spawn enemies. This scenario can be particularly problematic if the stage happens to feature a Family Event, especially the             Void Family Event.\nThe Defiant Gouge will stop working after the difficulty gets too high per amount of item, similar to Shrines of Combat, because of the extreme cost of each enemy that needs to be spawned. See Directors for more.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nExcerpt from the folk tale \u201cHymn of Aphocles\u201d:\n\n\u201c...The statue had been carved to the artist\u2019s creative vision. Beautiful and powerful, its mighty marble visage shone as radiantly as the moon. However, the common folk did not share the artist\u2019s vision. Declaring the statue imperfect, a single laborer took up his gouge and defiled the work, shaping it to his own selfish ideas of beauty.\n\nAdmiring his own work, the laborer confidently claimed that he had increased the beauty of the art tenfold. However, the artist did not hear these words. The artist felt only rage, rage at the laborer who had defiled his masterpiece, and rage at the common folk who lauded the laborer as a hero.\n\nAnd just as the laborer did not recognize the beauty of the untouched statue, so too did the laborer fail to recognize the shards of marble constricting around his leg.\u201d\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Defiant Gouge\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Monster Spawn Points: 100 (+100 per stack) \u21d2 40 (+40 per stack)  Developer Notes: A single Gouge would spawn way too many monsters.
