    "notes": "The Essence of Heresy is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2 and a part of the Heresy Set, released in the Anniversary Update. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Blockade Breaker Challenge.\nObtaining the Essence of Heresy will replace the Survivor's special skill (\"R\" by default on keyboard) with the Ruin skill. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nObtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the   Heretic.\nWith one or more  Lysate Cells, Ruin can still be inflicted as long as at least one charge of it remains. This also means that the shot fired by activating Ruin can inflict another stack of Ruin.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Commando has exceptional synergy with this item, as he can easily add stacks of {  Ruin with his   Double Tap and the fact that Ruin out scales both   Suppressive Fire and   Frag Grenade.\n Kjaro's Band,  Runald's Band, and  Singularity Band work very well with this item, being able to deal considerable extra damage when a large number of ruin stacks are detonated at once.\nNote that if ruin is applied to multiple enemies and detonated, the band activation will only apply to the first enemy hit with the projectiles fired from essence of heresy.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201c\u2026and her heart, too wicked and full of hate, was left where she once stood \u2013 at the site of her betrayal.\u201d\n\n-The Evisceration of Kur-skan the Heretic, VI\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lunar Item: Essence of Heresy\nAdded New Lore Entry: Essence of Heresy",
