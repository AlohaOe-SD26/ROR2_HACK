    "notes": "The Gesture of the Drowned is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the The Demons And The Crabs Challenge.\nThe first Gesture of the Drowned reduces the holder's equipment cooldown by half, but activates it as soon as it is ready. \nSubsequent Gestures reduce equipment cooldown by 15% each, the same amount as a  Fuel Cell.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe equipment cooldown is determined by the formula cooldown \u22c5 0.5 \u22c5 (1 - 0.15) ^ (amount - 1)\n\nIf the player has any  Fuel Cells, add that amount to the amount of Gestures of the Drowned (as long as the player has at least one Gesture).\n\n\n== Interactions ==\nOnly   MUL-T's active equipment will be activated by this item. The secondary equipment will not be used until it is swapped to via   Retool. This can be exploited to avoid the automatic activation for certain items, such as the  Preon Accumulator.\nDespite inheriting any held equipment,   Engineer's turrets will not activate any equipment even under the effects of this item.\n Royal Capacitor will not fire unless it has a target.\nIf multiple charges are stored with  Fuel Cells, all charges will be rapidly used back-to-back when a target is acquired.\n Trophy Hunter's Tricorn also will not fire unless it has a valid target.\n Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed) will be rapidly used, filling the chat with text messages. This may obscure helpful information, such as when teammates ping valuable information.\n The Crowdfunder will always be active, making it difficult to purchase items, since any gold the player collects will be immediately consumed.\nIn later stages this is generally a non-issue, since enemies will drop much more gold than The Crowdfunder will consume.\nEnabling the Artifact of Sacrifice mitigates this issue, since the player will not have to spend gold for chests.\nIn conjunction with enough Fuel Cells and/or additional Gestures (or  Soulbound Catalysts and enough kills before the effect expires), it is possible to keep certain item or equipment buffs active continuously.\nThis includes  War Horn,  Gorag's Opus,  Jade Elephant,  Milky Chrysalis,  Ocular HUD,  Radar Scanner (for interactables within range),  Super Massive Leech,  The Back-up (multiple uses stack),  Glowing Meteorite (multiple uses stack),  Helfire Tincture, and  Spinel Tonic (since the effect will never end, the player will never be afflicted with Tonic Afflictions, until they swap equipment).\n Executive Card can not be activated by Gesture of the Drowned, due to it activating automatically upon purchase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nFossils. Remnants. How cruel. \n\nThis moon once housed life. Life that you may have held dear, had the timing been right. But our timing was wrong. We were born much too late.\n\nNow, it is just calcium to me \u2013 and irrelevant to you. Isn\u2019t that right?\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Gesture of the Drowned\nQuality of Life\nUpdate visuals to match other assets\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nCooldown Reduction: 50%(+50% per stack) \u21d2 50% (+15% per stack)\nGoTD, unlike most other Lunar items, doesn\u2019t have stacking drawbacks, and should therefore stack more like a Tier 2 in power.\nBug Fixes\nFix equipment targets not being updated at the moment of firing (i.e  Woodsprite not being able to select targets with Gesture)\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3830295)\nBug Fixes\nPicking up new equipment with Gesture of the Drowned no longer fires every frame\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item being a nautilus shell and the item's title containing \"Drowned\" could possibly be a reference to a challenge from the original Risk of Rain, \"Sleepin' With The...\" in which the player had to kill 20 Whorls by drowning them. Additionally, to \"drown\" the Whorls, the player needed to knock them off of cliffs. The unlock requirement for this item requires the player to do the same to 20 Hermit Crabs, another shelled creature.",
