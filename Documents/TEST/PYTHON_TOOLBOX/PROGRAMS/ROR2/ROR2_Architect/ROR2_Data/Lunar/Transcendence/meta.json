    "notes": "The Transcendence is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2.\nIt increases the holder's maximum health by 50% (+25% per stack), but replaces all but 1 of their health with shields, which regenerate over a period of 2 seconds after avoiding damage for 7 seconds. Any health gained afterwards, such as by leveling up or picking up health-increasing items, will also be increased and converted into shields.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe holder needs to avoid damage for 7 seconds before they can begin regaining shields. Mobility and dodging are crucial to using this item.\nBecause shields cannot be healed outside of recharging naturally, healing items become redundant.\n N'kuhana's Opinion continues to store healing by using the new shield-based maximum health for all calculations.\nObtaining an  Aegis transforms all excess healing into barriers.\nPercentage-based healing, such as  Bustling Fungus and  Foreign Fruit, will calculate their healing based on the holder's new maximum health of 1, making them effectively useless even with an Aegis.\nConversely, in the event that the player has little to no healing, the Transcendence can be a great help, providing a way to regain health more quickly.\nTaking damage over time can delay the timer for the health regeneration until the effect wears off. Be especially sure to avoid damage from these sources.\n Infusion and  Bison Steak benefit from the Transcendence's health increase, but the  Personal Shield Generator does not. Keep this in mind when choosing how to further augment health.\n Tougher Times will allow the player to have a chance to recharge shields in combat, and  Old War Stealthkits can help the user regain their shields out of danger by temporarily cloaking them.\nObtaining 3 or more stacks of  Strides of Heresy, or a single stack of Strides of Heresy and a  Hardlight Afterburner, makes   Shadowfade last long enough for the player to fully recharge their shields while invulnerable.\nSince fall damage calculation uses the player's health without accounting for shields or barriers, the Transcendence effectively reduces all fall damage to 1 point.\nThis makes the Transcendence useful for Survivors who lack skills to avoid fall damage, namely   Engineer,   Captain, and   MUL-T.\nThis item should be avoided at all costs when using   REX's \"plant\" skills that cost health (  Seed Barrage,   Bramble Volley, and   Tangling Growth). The Transcendence completely dismantles these skills' internal synergy of damaging REX to attack and healing to recoup the costs, and as a result it is colloquially known as a run-killer for this Survivor.\nThe  Silence Between Two Strikes equipment does not apply the 50% shield effect if the survivor has Transcendence, since all of the survivor's health is already converted into shield.\nA player holding Transcendence becomes functionally immune to the   healing disabled debuff of   Malachite Elites, as shield regeneration is not considered healing.\nHowever, they must still contend with Malachite monsters' greatly increased attack strength.\nSince the Transcendence sets the holder's health regeneration to 0, the negative health regeneration on the   Heretic is removed, preventing her from inevitably dying over time.\nHolding Transcendence and  Kinetic Dampener essentailly grants permanent armor, although you won't be able to activate the stunning pulse unless you survive a hit with 1 health.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nYou are trying your best to survive. You consider yourself a fast learner. You have been feeling lucky. You have been experiencing feelings of deja vu. If you understand, do not read the next paragraph.\n\nYou are taking control of your own beliefs. You feel familiar in unfamiliar environments. You have been gaining an intuition for experiences you've never had. You ponder a past life. If you understand, do not read the next paragraph.\n\nYou find yourself searching for things that never have been. You miss things you have never had. You play characters that have never lived. You have been experiencing feelings of deja vu. If you understand, do not read the next paragraph.\n\nYou have revealed my hand. Because you have consumed this information, the [observers] will now consume it in time. If you are reading this paragraph, I will be long dead, but in turn you have freed me. I will no longer exist in my universe. There will be no proof that I ever was - but I exist now in yours. I have escaped my suffering. Keep me safe. I hope you do not understand.",
