    "notes": "Eulogy Zero is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nWhen entering a new stage, there is a 5% (+5% per stack) chance for each item generated in the stage to be replaced with a random lunar item instead. This affects items in Chests, 3D Printers, Void Cradles, Void Potential Orbs, Rusted/Encrusted Lockboxes, the Teleporter reward, and the Cauldrons in the   Bazaar Between Time. It also affects any item dropped while the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled, and the item dropped when using the  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn. However, it does not affect Elite equipment drops.\nEulogy Zero also affects items given to monsters. This applies to the items   Scavengers spawn with, the items given to monsters from the Artifact of Evolution, and the items monsters gain in the   Void Fields and Simulacrum.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nEulogy Zero is a completely global effect. Any loot source that can be replaced will have the chance, regardless if the player who caused the item to drop has Eulogy or not.\nAs it is a global effect, it cannot be luck affected.\nItems in chests are replaced when the stage is generated.\nThis means that, if picking up Eulogy Zero mid-stage from e.g. a Lunar Pod, it will not take effect until the next stage's loot is generated.\nA 3D Printer that is affected by Eulogy Zero will print the displayed lunar item, but the rarity of the input item will be as though the printer was unaffected. For instance, a 3D Printer that printed white items but was affected will print 1 white item into the displayed lunar item.\nEulogy Zero can cause Scavengers to spawn with lunar items, but it does not affect their scavenging skill that gives them additional items; no matter how many Eulogy Zero the player team has, a Scavenger can never pick up a lunar item after it spawns.\nThe loot options generated by a Void Potential roll indepedently for replacement.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nEulogy Zero cannot replace certain drops, such as  Artifact Keys and every source of temporary items.\nThe items dropped after opening a Scavenger's sack cannot be replaced.\nBe wary that  Prison Matrix can be replaced, despite also being a quest item.\nEulogy Zero does not care about the required or banned item tags of the drop table it is replacing. As such, you could get  Shaped Glass from a Healing Chest, or get AIBlacklisted Lunar items onto enemies.\nFinding a Common Printer that had its item's replaced with a Lunar item, is one of the main upsides of this item.\nEulogy Zero can make it easier to amass huge amounts of lunar items to feed into a Cleansing Pool to get many  Pearls and  Irradiant Pearls, as the holder will find lunar items in the world naturally without having to pay lunar coins (or can print non-lunar items into lunar items).\nWith high stacks of Eulogy Zero, it will take longer to Cleanse yourself, as some of the Pearls will be replaced into Lunars which will need to be cleansed again.\nIf the player is lucky enough to find an Overgrown 3D Printer afterwards, Pearls and Irradiant Pearls can then be converted into high stacks of valuable boss items.\nEulogy Zero can make it easier to find the Heresy items, as they can also replace other items.\nAlthough the chance is small, in scenarios where enemies get items, i.e.,   Void Fields, Simulacrum, Artifact of Evolution, or   Scavengers, it is possible for enemies to gain dangerous lunar items like  Shaped Glass or  Egocentrism.\nWith the Artifact of Evolution and Simulacrum, where item accruement is permanent, it is possible for monsters to gain more stacks of Eulogy Zero, which can have a snowball effect.\nSince Eulogy Zero is capable of replacing the items given to monsters from Artifact of Evolution, it is possible for monsters to eventually collect all four Heresy items and thus transform into   Heretic\n\n\n== Lore ==\nA eulogy for the victors of spiritual warfare:\n\nThis is a message from me to you.\n\nThough in life you will stumble, stammer and fall - though you will lose your loved ones and shed more tears than your eyes can muster - in time you can find peace on the planets you call home. A small creature waiting quietly for you, a smiling face from another stream, the silence as you breathe in the scent of a new season.\n\nLet your heart remind you why you are here; let it tell you something new and something old. A mind remembers, but a heart knows.\n\nI love me so that I can love you too -  I've wanted to disappear before, but I've always wanted to return to see you. The grass and the leaves, the warmth of the sun and the insects at night. \n\nI promised myself, and I promise you: \n\nA victory is the reward of cumulative loss, ever present as a light at the end of the tunnel. Even in death, there is the lingering promise of new life - forever doomed to repeat the cycle.\n\nIt's getting dark. If you get lost it's alright, for now. I hope you enjoy the shooting stars. Rest in peace.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Eulogy Zero\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item is named after Nick Bizzozero, modeller and animator for Hopoo Games.",
