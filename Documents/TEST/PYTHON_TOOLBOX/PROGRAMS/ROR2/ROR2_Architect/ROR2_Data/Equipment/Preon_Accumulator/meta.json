    "notes": "The Preon Accumulator is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the REDACTED Challenge.\nWhen activated, a 2 second long charging animation plays before firing a large, slow-moving ball of energy. This projectile shoots lightning bolts 3 times per second at enemies within 35m for 400% damage per bolt, each with a proc coefficient of 0.1, and explodes on contact with an enemy or terrain, dealing 8000% damage in a 20m radius with a proc coefficient of 1.0. Upon firing the ball, a reasonable amount of recoil pushes the user backwards.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: This equipment actually deals twice as much damage as the game claims.\nThe Preon Accumulator can be found in a special chest within 10 minutes of starting a run (in-game timer, not real time).\nA Preon Accumulator is required to complete the challenge MUL-T: Gotcha!\nThe explosion has a damage falloff starting from 15m and ends at 20m, falling off to about 25% of the explosions damage.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nSince this equipment has the longest cooldown in the game, it is recommended to activate it wisely if the player has no equipment cooldown items, such as  Fuel Cells or  Soulbound Catalyst.\nIt is recommended to not use the  Gesture of the Drowned, as it will force the Preon Accumulator to fire whenever ready. This makes it likely that the player will waste a high-damage attack.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Particle Accelerator Component\n\nTracking Number: 993******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 06/06/2056\n\nShipping Method: Volatile\n\nShipping Address: Advance Particle Research Center, Mesquite, Earth\n\nI still don't get how you keep losing so many accumulators. I build 'em tough, and they're supposed to last. I ran the numbers on the comm speeds, and I'm pretty sure you sent for this order less than two days after you should've got the last one. \n\nIf this keeps up, you're gonna punch a hole in something where it doesn't belong. You've got a real good sponsor, Jim, but this stuff ain't cheap to ship. And it sure as heck ain't fast. So, I'm sending you a custom part. One that's as tough as I can make, and with a safety to keep you from overcharging it - that I'm sure you'll bypass anyway. \n\nAt least try not to blow this one to bits for the first week, alright? Make our hometown look good. You're not gonna show up those fancy Europeans with a smoking scrap heap.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Preon Accumulator\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4233443)\nBug Fixes\nFix Preon Accumulator sometimes missing in multiplayer\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Preon Accumulator is very similar in function to the BFG from DOOM, and is called the BFG in the game files.\nThe shipping address being listed in the logbook as Mesquite, Texas is a reference to the book Masters of Doom, where it explains how DOOM was made, specifically in Mesquite.\nThe tracking number is likely also a reference to DOOM, which was originally released in 1993.\nMUL-T: Gotcha! is also a reference to DOOM, named after a level from DOOM 2 and requiring the player to kill an Imp Overlord using the Preon Accumulator.\nThe item's lore says \"If this keeps up, you're gonna punch a hole in something where it doesn't belong\" which might be a reference to \"BFG-10000\" mission in DOOM: Eternal, where you shoot a hole into the surface of Mars\nThis equipment is visible mounted on commando's shoulder, in the cover art of the game.\nThe Preon Accumulator is generally in a 'closed' state, upon starting the firing animation, the weapon opens up, seperating the tendrils from each other.\nThe equipment is generally mounted on the right shoulder of the player model, with the exceptions of acrid and artificer, who wield the weapon on their right shoulder, while engineer and railgunner wield it above themselves.",
