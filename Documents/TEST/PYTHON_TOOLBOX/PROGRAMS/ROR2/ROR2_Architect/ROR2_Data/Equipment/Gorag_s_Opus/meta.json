    "notes": "Gorag's Opus is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen activated, it gives the {  Team War Cry buff to all allies (including drones and turrets) for 7 seconds, giving them 50% increased movement speed and 100% increased attack speed.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nPair the Opus with the  War Horn to get even more attack speed when activating it.\nSince a bonus to attack and move speed is virtually always welcome, obtaining a  Gesture of the Drowned removes the need to micro-manage the equipment and also grants greatly reduced cooldown.\nGiving Gorag's Opus to an  Equipment Drone frees up the player's equipment slot, and the drone's innate cooldown reduction means that it will only need 9 seconds to recharge the Opus.\nThe Team War Cry buff does not stack with the {  War Cry buff from the  Berzerker's Pauldron. In fact, the two buffs cannot coexist, so whichever is activated later can overwrite the other.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nAudio transcription complete from \"Carrion Crows Tour 2055: Special Edition\"\n\nPrinting...\n\n\"Halfway through the tour we were at this little shop down in Groveside and the guy at the desk is trying to sell us random junk.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he was totally out of the loop, had no idea who we were.\"\n\n\"Yep, anyways, as a joke, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll buy this ancient looking drum and use it on stage at the next show. Then we\u2019d circle back and show this guy a video of his merch being used in the biggest performance on the planet.\"\n\n\"We tried to find him again, but the shop was all shut down. Couldn\u2019t figure out what happened to him.\"\n\n\"Thing is, that drum drove our fans wild. It turned out to be our most successful tour ever.\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix Gorag\u2019s Opus not working on   Captain,   Engi, or   Equipment Drones\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Equipment: Gorag's Opus\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Gorag's Opus\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
