    "notes": "His Reassurance is an Elite equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {  Mending Elite. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Mending Elite, but this chance is affected by  57 Leaf Clover and  Purity.\nA player equipped with His Reassurance gains the power of a Mending Elite; they will heal all nearby allies over time, and spawn a   Healing Core on death.\nAlthough His Reassurance is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from  Fuel Cell do not affect its behavior.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nHeals the nearest ally within 30m for 40% of the holder's base damage 4 times per second. This is unaffected by any damage boosting items, such as  Delicate Watch or  Focus Crystal.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nSince this equipment only ever supports allies, it is considerably less useful in single-player runs. Non-player allies that can be healed are turrets, drones, the gummy clone from  Goobo Jr.,  Happiest Mask ghosts,   Alpha Constructs from the  Defense Nucleus, allied   Aurelionite, the   Solus Probes from the  Empathy Cores,   Beetle Guards from the  Queen's Gland, and all of the  Newly Hatched Zoea's summons.\nSurprisingly, this equipment is not particularly helpful for   Engineer, since Mending Elites cannot heal each other. If Engineer and his turrets are all Mending, none of them will directly benefit each other.\nDue to   Captain's emphasis on having many drone allies nearby for defense, he can use this equipment well to make his supportive drone swarm even more survivable.\nGiving this equipment to an   Equipment Drone will give the player an ally that flies nearby and constantly heals them, along with any other drones that may be around, effectively turning the Equipment Drone into an even better   Healing Drone or   Emergency Drone.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void Update\nMajor Content\n(Undocumented) Introduced.\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
