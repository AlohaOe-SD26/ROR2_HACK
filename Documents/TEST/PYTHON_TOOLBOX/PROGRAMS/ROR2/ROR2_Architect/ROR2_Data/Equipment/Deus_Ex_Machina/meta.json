    "notes": "The Deus Ex Machina is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Alloyed Collective expansion.\nUpon use, gain 0.5 seconds of parrying, during which ANY damage can be blocked, granting a blessing afterwards.\nOnly skill damage will be able to consume and use the blessed status.\nIf a blessed attack kills, chance based on-kill effects are also guaranteed.\n \n\n\n== Tips ==\nA big synergy with this equipment is  Lost Seer's Lenses, as it can be used to guarantee a one shot an enemy.\nOr entire groups of enemies with AoE items such as  Ukulele.\nAs any damage can trigger the parrying effect, this can lead to some quirks and strategies.\nPredictable damage like fall damage, blood purchases,   REX attacks can easily be parried.\nDamage over time effects that are less timing heavy. (Burn, Void Fog,  Warped Echo)\nVoid Implosions can be blocked, similar to   Mercenary.\nAs the blessing also guarantees chance based on kill effects if the blessed attack kills, this equipment can be used to guarantee  Sonorous Whispers drops from Elite enemies.\nActivating this equipment too quickly will cause it to not work.\nHaving two  Fuel Cell's is enough to refund the cooldown upon a successful parry.\nHaving a  Gesture of the Drowned and 25  Gesture of the Drowned/ Fuel Cell's is enough for permanent parry window uptime.\nYou can transfer the cooldown refund onto other equipments with   Retool or  Functional Coupler.\n  Operator's   H3-11 OCR Custom Ricochet shot's all trigger bless.\nParrying   Void Fog resets the damage over time scaling.\nThe effects of this equipment are not granted to the meteors spawned by  Runic Lens due to how that item does not retain information regarding the proc chain, and as such are not guaranteed to trigger any on hit or on kill effects. (Deus Ex Machina still guarantees a  Runic Lens to be triggered otherwise if the limit of 1 meteor per character has not been reached.)\nConsequentlly this does not make Deus Ex Machina any more able to consistently trigger the potential infinite loop that can happen with  Runic Lens and another on hit item than without the Deus Ex Machina.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nFIELDTECH Image-To-Text Translator (v2.5.10b)\n\n# Awaiting input... done.\n\n# Reading image for text... done.\n\n# Transcribing data... done.\n\n# Translating text... done.
