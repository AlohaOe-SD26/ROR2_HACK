    "notes": "The Silence Between Two Strikes is an Elite equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from an {  Overloading Elite. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Overloading Elite, but this chance is affected by the  57 Leaf Clover and  Purity.\nA player equipped with the Silence Between Two Strikes gains the power of an Overloading Elite; 50% of their health is replaced by shields, and their attacks attach lightning bombs to enemies, which explode after a brief pause dealing 50% total damage. The bombs do not have a proc coefficient. \nAlthough the Silence Between Two Strikes is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated.  Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from  Fuel Cells do not affect its behavior.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe 50% shield is gained when picking up the Silence Between Two Strikes, regardless of the player's current health. For instance, while a player at full health will immediately lose half of their health and have it replaced with shields, a player at 1 health out of 300 total will simply gain 150 shield points instantly.\nWhile this equipment gives an effective 50% boost to damage output, converting half of the holder's health into shields can be a nuisance. Shields cannot be healed through normal means and only replenish after avoiding damage for 7 seconds, so players who take damage frequently will virtually always be at half health.\nThis equipment has no passive shield effect if the survivor has a  Transcendence in their inventory.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe name refers to the silence between lightning striking and hearing thunder. This name is further reflected by the lightning bombs (the silence between the player landing a hit, and the bomb exploding).\nThis equipment can be exploited by   MUL-T when paired with the ability   Retool. Damage taken without the Silence Between Two Strikes can be recovered when switching to this equipment and back again. (Last tested V1.2.4.1)\nThis is also the case with  Shared Design.\nWhen an enemy is killed, it\u2019s whole body is covered in blue energy and disintegrates into blue splinters of light instead of falling over or exploding like they normally would.  If the bombs placed on an enemy have not detonated, they stay in the air until they explode.\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
