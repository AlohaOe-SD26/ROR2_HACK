    "notes": "Seed of Life is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion. It is unlocked after completing the King of the Hill Challenge by defeating the   False Son on   Prime Meridian.\nThe equipment allows the player to revive once upon death. In multiplayer, activating Seed of Life will revive any dead players, regardless of range.\nAfter use, the equipment is \"consumed\", replacing it with  Seed of Life (Consumed) which places a sprout on the ground on use that drops healing orbs, each orb healing for 2% of maximum health.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n  Engineer Turrets will make use the passive Reviving effect.\nIn singleplayer, Seed of Life cannot be manually activated and can only be used automatically upon death.\nSeed of Life will always revive its holder when killed, even if the Equipment slot is disabled by debuffs like   Disable All Skills.\nWhen the Seed of Life automatically revives its holder, it is \"consumed\" but not activated, bypassing the 60 second cooldown that occurs if it is activated to revive an ally. This allows the Seed of Life (Consumed) or a swapped equipment to be used immediately without waiting for the cooldown.\nThe sprout spawned by Seed of Life (Consumed) will spawn a healing orb every 0.5s over the course of 5 seconds, for a total of 10 orbs (20% of maximum health).\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThick evening mist wraps the Queen like a sentient cloak. \"Children, tonight we show these wretched demons our grief. Fight and fall and fight again. Take his [blessing] and go.\u201d\nA stream of Beetles march up the dead tree\u2019s hollow. A Beetle Guard stops to face an alcove and it\u2019s units pause behind him, antennae twitching. The Guard crosses it\u2019s front legs above it\u2019s head, \"Deathless are we.\", it sticks a pronged seed to it\u2019s underbelly.\nOn the surface, Beetles pour from lifeless stumps in neat lines. A thousand forms shrink into the Eastern horizon in a golden thread.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nSeed of Life - Now works as expected when given to an   Equipment Drone, and the consumed version can no longer teleport players out of bounds\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nSeed of Life",
