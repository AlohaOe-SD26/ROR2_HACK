    "notes": "Aurelionite's Blessing is an Elite equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion. It can only be found as a rare drop from a   Gilded Elite. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Gilded Elite, but this chance is affected by  57 Leaf Clover and  Purity.\nA player equipped with Aurelionite's Blessing gains the power of a Gilded Elite; gold nuggets fly out of enemies on hit. Gold nuggets can be picked up to gain 8 gold (scaling with time) and will vanish after 10 seconds if not collected.\nUnlike other Elite equipments, Aurelionite's Blessing actually does have an active effect. Activating Aurelionite's Blessing summons a spike attack on a surface where the player is looking. The attack has two rings of damage summoned with a short delay: the outer ring first, dealing 15% damage, and the inner ring second, dealing 150% damage. This has a 25 second cooldown.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThere is no limit to how many gold nuggets an enemy can drop and there is a very short cooldown between the next hit that will drop a gold nugget (roughly 0.5 seconds), meaning this equipment can be used to quickly amass huge amounts of gold.\nGold will still be dropped from enemies on hit while the equipment is on cooldown.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\n(Undocumented) Reworked to match the reworks to Gilded Elites\nSeekers of the Storm\n(Undocumented) Added new item: Aurelionite's Blessing\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
