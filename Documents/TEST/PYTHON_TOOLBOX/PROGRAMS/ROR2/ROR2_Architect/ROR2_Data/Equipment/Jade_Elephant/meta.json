The clang of the flat tool against the beautiful, translucent green sheen of the solid surface echoed through the trees and around all the villagers. Their souls were cleansed and made whole by the heavenly stone, now formed into the imposing presence of an elephant.\n\nDetermination and resolve had essentially been carved into the very spirit of the ones who, just moments ago, were clutching their farming implements and make-shift weapons with trembling hands. The attack was repelled that day. The Emperor\u2019s army told stories about their metal weapons bouncing off the cloth of commoners. This inspiring encounter spread to other villages and...\u201d\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Jade Elephant\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Equipment: Jade Elephant",
