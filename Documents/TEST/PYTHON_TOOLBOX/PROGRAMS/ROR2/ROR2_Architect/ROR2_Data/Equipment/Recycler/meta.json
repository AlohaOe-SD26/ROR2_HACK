    "notes": "The Recycler is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Cleanup Duty Challenge.\nThis equipment can be used on dropped items and equipment to transform the item into another of the same rarity, indicated by an orange reticle around the targeted item. The recycled item can be any item of the same tier and item pool, excluding the original item. Once an item has been recycled, it cannot be recycled again and displays a red \"X\" over the recycler indicator.\nThe Recycler cannot recycle any items that have been recycled once already, including items recycled by another player in multiplayer.\nThe Recycler cannot recycle any WorldUnique Items, the  Fuel Array,  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed), or Elite Equipment.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nWhen used along with a 3D Printer, this can be used to turn a random item (of the Printer's rarity) in the player's inventory into another random item.\nIf an Environment contains both a 3D Printer and a   Scrapper, the player can get alternative items by repeatedly printing, recycling, and scrapping any unwanted items. This can be especially useful for Mili-Tech and Overgrown 3D Printers, to find desirable Legendary and Boss items respectively.\nThis equipment is useful by eliminating unwanted items and providing a chance to turn them into something better.\nHaving a  Gesture of the Drowned results in the Recycler automatically transforming items when players look at them. This can be avoided by walking into the item backwards, or otherwise keeping them out of the field of view before picking them up.\nThe Recycler can be used to recycle Lunar Items and Equipment as well as Void Items.\nThe Recycler technically recycles the Pickup Object that holds the displayed item. If there two items in two different locations, the player can recycle one item, transfer the recycled item and swap it with the other item, and then recycle the previously recycled item at the second location. A more simple explanation would be that this equipment recycles the \"spots\" where items are instead of items themselves.\nIn practice, this means that if there are two equipments in a stage and the player wishes to keep one but recycle the other, they can recycle the unwanted one and then swap their positions to then recycle the unwanted one again if desired, as the game will recognize that the recycler was used in two different locations and not that it was used on the same item. Since other items are permanently collected, this oddity is really only practical for Equipment.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: \u201cTY-6G Recycler\u201d\n\nTracking Number: 02******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 11\\06\\2056\\\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: 700 Baler Ave, Seattle, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nStandard issue recycling apparatus TY-6G.
