    "notes": "The Ocular HUD is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2.\nWhile activated, the player gets the {  Full Crit status for 8 seconds, giving them +100% critical strike chance.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item can help activate  Predatory Instincts,  Harvester's Scythe, and more rarely  Shatterspleen obtained early in a run when the player has minimal critical strike chance.\nThe attack speed buff from  War Horn is quite helpful for getting the most use out of these items as well, and one stack lasts exactly as long as the HUD does.\nCollecting  Fuel Cells and  Gestures of the Drowned, it is possible to gain 100% uptime on the guaranteed critical strikes. While usually more difficult than collecting 9 or 10  Lens-Maker's Glasses, it allows a player to run  Lost Seer's Lenses without losing use of items that rely on critical strikes.\nThe HUD is somewhat less useful for   Bandit, as his passive   Backstab makes it irrelevant if the player is skilled enough to get behind enemies.\n  Railgunner's   Magnetic Accelerator turns the +100% critical strike chance into +100% critical strike damage when used.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Ocular HUD\n\nTracking Number: 871*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 09/06/2056\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: Greivenkamp, 5th Houston St, Prism Tower, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nI wish you hadn't asked me for help. I was contacted by [REDACTED] and they explained... well, some things. Using their instructions, I was able to design this interface for prolonged exactness. The beauty of it all is that it will compound with any previous precision enhancing tools. Digital plus optical is the way to go.\n\nWhile I still don't know everything, I feel like I'm already in too deep. You won't hear from me anymore after this.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Ocular HUD\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3961583)\nBug Fixes\nFix the   Artificer's Oculur HUD being stretched\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3703355)\nBug Fixes\nHolding the Primary Skill Button down while activating Ocular HUD and shooting with   Mul-T   Auto-Nailgun no longer deals infinite critical damage.",
