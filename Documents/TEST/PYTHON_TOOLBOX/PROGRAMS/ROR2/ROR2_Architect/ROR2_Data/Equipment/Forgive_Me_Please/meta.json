    "notes": "The Forgive Me Please is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the I Love Dying! Challenge.\nWhen activated, the player throws a doll in front of them. This doll triggers all on-kill effect items the player has, as if the player had killed an enemy where the doll landed. It does this once per second and eight times in total.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nEach player can have up to 3 dolls active at once, and the equipment cannot be activated again until one of the dolls is used up.\nThis is due to the fact that if the player had a  Soulbound Catalyst and a  Gesture of the Drowned, the Forgive Me Please will activate the Soulbound Catalyst, reducing its own cooldown enough to automatically spawn another doll.  This limit was added since this would escalate to the point where there would be enough dolls and on-kill effects to overload and crash the game.\nThe  Soulbound Catalyst pairs excellently with the Forgive Me Please, where 1 doll reduces the equipment's cooldown by 32 seconds over its 8 second activation period. This creates a 5-second downtime between spawning dolls. Any kills caused by the activated effects of the doll will further reduce this cooldown, even possibly causing the equipment to finish recharging before the current doll expires.\nThe Forgive Me Please has a chance to drop Lunar Coins.\nSince Lunar Coins can activate the pressure plates on   Abandoned Aqueduct, placing the equipment on top of them provides a way, albeit inconsistent and time-consuming, to activate the plates if the player lacks any other resources.\nOn-kill effects that have specific activation conditions will not be activated by Forgive Me Please. These items are:  Brainstalks,   Happiest Mask,  Wake of Vultures,  Shatterspleen, and  Defense Nucleus.\nBrainstalks, Wake of Vultures, and Defense Nucleus will not activate even if the Artifact of Honor is active.\nThe Forgive Me Please will charge  Infusions and the  Resonance Disc.\nThe Forgive Me Please will stick to whatever surface it lands on. This is useful for placing it on an enemy, or an ally surrounded by enemies, as any on-kill effects will consistently hit the target.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThere is a note pinned to the doll:\n\nAyy, you\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re really killing me.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.0.2.0\nBug Fixes\nFixed throwing Forgive Me Please off a cliff causing it to not release its deployable slot until the next stage\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix Forgive Me Please not triggering  Frost Relic\nFix Forgive Me Please not triggering  Berzerker\u2019s Pauldrons\nFix Forgive Me Please not animating or playing effects on non-host machines\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Equipment: Forgive Me Please\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Forgive Me Please\nAdded New Challenge:  I Love Dying!\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Forgive Me Please is likely a reference to an item featured in the original Risk of Rain, the Crudely Drawn Buddy. Upon using the Crudely Drawn Buddy, a decoy doll appears, which attracts the attention of monsters for several seconds.\nThe Crudely Drawn Buddy doll takes on the appearance of any survivor who activates it, whereas the doll dropped by Forgive Me Please only resembles the   Commando.",
