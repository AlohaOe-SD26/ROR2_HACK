    "notes": "The Shared Design is an Elite equipment. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {  Perfected Elite. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Perfected Elite, but this chance is affected by the  57 Leaf Clover and  Purity.\nA player equipped with the Shared Design gains the powers of a Perfected Elite: \n\nTheir attacks{  Cripple enemies.\nEvery 10 seconds in combat, they fire 4 bombs dealing 30% damage each.\nThey get +30% movement speed.\nThey gain 25% maximum health, but have all but 1 of their health replaced with shields, similar to  Transcendence.\nAlthough the Shared Design is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from  Fuel Cells do not affect its behavior.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nConverting all health into shields that cannot be healed normally is not to be undertaken lightly. See  Transcendence for an exhaustive list of effects.\nGiving the Shared Design to an   Equipment Drone can be very helpful, since it can damage and Cripple enemies, and the player will not have to replace all their health.\nEquipment Drones do not spawn on   Commencement, so the player must repair one and bring it with them to Commencement, then allow it to be destroyed. After this, they must give it the Shared Design when obtained.\nAlternatively, the Shared Design can drop during a          Lunar Family Event on   Sky Meadow after stage 6, making it possible (albeit extremely unlikely) to give it to an Equipment Drone before heading to Commencement.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n  Bandit and   Heretic are the only Survivors who do not have the glowing halo of a Perfected Elite while they are Perfected.\nThis equipment can be exploited by   MUL-T when paired with the ability   Retool. Damage taken without the Shared Design can be recovered when switching to this equipment and back again. (Last tested V1.2.4.1)\nThis is also the case with  Silence Between Two Strikes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
