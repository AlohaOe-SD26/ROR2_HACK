    "notes": "Predatory Instincts is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Rapidfire Challenge.\nThe first Predatory Instincts a player obtains grants +5% critical strike chance. Stacking more Predatory Instincts will not increase critical strike chance further.\nWhen the holder lands a critical strike, they get a stack of   Attack Speed On Crit for 3 seconds, increasing their attack speed by 12%. The holder can have up to 3 (+2 per stack) stacks of this buff, for up to 36% (+24% per stack) increased attack speed.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description does not specify the +5% critical strike chance.\nThe duration of the buff is multiplied by the proc coefficient of the attack.\nThe in-game item description can be misleading, making the \"Stacks up to 3 times\" in the description seem like the item itself only stacks 3 times. This is false, and the 3 stack limit is referring to the   Attack Speed On Crit buff the item gives.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nGossip spreads quickly in terrified communities. Stories that keep the more fearful lizardfolk in their passageways. Hushed tales that frighten the most commanding of stone constructs and woodfolk and creatures of the plains. Fear travels between the trees and the valleys.\n\nA demon, fallen from the Sky, mighty enough to slay Providence and his Wurms. Only two arms, two legs - but with 22 unblinking, crimson eyes.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nRemove proc effect growing in size for each stack.\nBuff Duration: 2s \u21d2 3s\nBug Fixes\nFix Predatory Instincts sound not playing over the network\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item's lore entry alludes to players stacking  Lens-Maker's Glasses in Risk of Rain 1, claiming that the creature that killed Providence, the final boss of the game, had \"22 unblinking, crimson eyes.\"\nIn Risk of Rain 1, Lens-Maker's Glasses did not grant a 10% increase to critical strike chance, but rather 7%. Reaching 100% critical strike chance required 14 Lens-Maker's Glasses.",
