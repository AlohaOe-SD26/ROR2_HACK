    "notes": "The Bandolier is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen the holder kills an enemy, there is an 18% (+10% per stack) chance that the enemy will drop an ammo pack. When collected, the ammo pack resets all skill cooldowns.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nAny ally (including non-player allies) can collect the ammo pack, not just the player who has the Bandolier.\nFor skills that have multiple charges, such as   Engineer's turrets or secondary skills with  Backup Magazine, an ammo pack will refresh whatever one full recharge grants, usually only one charge, and the next charge will start from full cooldown.\nThe exceptions to this are   Hungering Gaze, granted by the  Visions of Heresy, and   Scrap Launcher since these skills recover all stacks at once when their cooldown finishes.\nThe drop chance is affected by Luck.\nPicking up an ammo pack does not reset equipment cooldown.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nActivating the  Forgive Me Please with a Bandolier drops up to 8 ammo packs.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe chance to drop an ammo pack is determined by the formula 1\u22121/(1+x)0.33, with x being the amount of bandoliers.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Bandolier\n\nTracking Number: 112*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 04/19/2056\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: 3950 Sunsell Ln, Tri-City, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nThank you for your participation in the auction!
