    "notes": "The AtG Missile Mk. 1 is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \nOn hitting an enemy, the player has a 10% chance to launch a homing missile that deals 300% (+300% per stack) total damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0. This chance to trigger is multiplied by the proc coefficient of the attack.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item is extremely powerful on any character when stacked, especially in combination with other total damage items such as the  Ukulele and  Molten Perforator.\nTwo AtGs is enough to activate  Kjaro's Band and  Runald's Band with almost any attack, making these items viable for Survivors who don't have a high-damage skill.\nAtGs will critical strike if the hit that fired the missle is also a critical strike. Therefore AtGs will benefit from the effects of  Lens-Maker's Glasses  and  Harvester's Scythe.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nFixing a spare bayonet onto his shotgun, he glanced at the horizon. The thundering of footsteps big and small was growing louder and louder \u2013 they were nearly upon him. He went over his kit one last time.\n\nFive bayonets. Twenty three packs of incendiary explosives. Fifteen magazines of armor-piercing ammunition. Thirty three sticky bombs. Four tear-gas grenades, and so on.\n\nAnd his favorite \u2013 two shoulder-mounted missile launchers, loaded with six AtG Viper Missiles. Heat seeking, detonation power of 15 pounds of TNT per missile. Light-weight, and the best part \u2013 automatic firing mechanism. He initially favored a more analog approach to his weapons, but the thing had grown on him.\n\nTurning to face the oncoming mob, he loaded his shotgun. The adrenaline started pumping.\n\n\u201cBring it on.\u201d\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: AtG Missile Mk. 1\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nDamage: 300% (+300% per stack) additive damage \u21d2 300% (+300% per stack) total damage\nTo compensate for the Crit fix, we\u2019ve moved over on-hit effects to deal a percentage of TOTAL damage. That is, if you have a proc that deals 300% damage from an attack that hits for 100, it will hit for 300. Previously it was a complicated additive formula - this change is either neutral or a buff for every character, and GREATLY benefits slow, high-damage attacks like the Artificer\u2019s.",
