    "notes": "The Shuriken is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nThe item grants the   Shuriken buff, which stacks up to 3 (+1 per stack) times over 10 seconds. When the holder's primary skill is used, a shuriken projectile is launched forward at the same time, dealing 400% (+100% per stack) damage with a 1.0 Proc Coefficient and consuming one stack of the Shuriken buff.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe projectiles weakly home in on enemies, but in practice this can actually be a liability, because it often prioritize closer enemies instead of what the player is aiming at. Due to how slowly the projectile curves, this usually results in missing both enemies.\nNon-primary skills can also throw Shurikens if they use the primary attack input, since these work by temporarily replacing the primary skill. For instance, this means that   Railgunner will always activate the Shuriken when shooting, as her other skills simply change the effect of her primary. The same applies when aiming   Captain's   Orbital Probe and   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike, and when firing   Engineer's   Thermal Harpoons.\nIn addition to this. certain  survivors will activate the shuriken before actually firing. Such as   Captain's vulcan shotgun firing while aiming. Or   Engineer's bouncing grenades firing before the engineer releases them.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe charge cooldown is determined by the formula f(x)=10(amount+2).\n\n\n== Tips ==\nShurikens on melee-based characters like   Acrid or   Loader can give them a ranged attack while activating their primary.\nHowever,   Loader does not gain barrier from Shurikens, as her passive only affects her gauntlets.\nShurikens on   Captain are harder to utilize, as they activate as soon as he charges his primary, rather than when he releases the shot.\nThe lock-on attacks for   Huntress can activate Shurikens, but will only work with a target in sight.\nA single stack of Shurikens deals enough damage to activate the  Kjaro's,  Runald's, and  Singularity Bands, allowing characters such as   Engineer and   Commando to more consistently activate them. Conversely, characters with strong single-hit skills can lose out on damage output if Shurikens activate bands instead.\nNotably, Engineer's turrets can use Shurikens with their attack, allowing them to use the Bands as well.\nShuriken stacking has both diminishing and quadratic returns. One stack of Shurikens can deal 1200% base damage per ten seconds. A second stack only increases this by 800% base damage, however each additional stack adds 200% more than the last (D=(x+200%)(x+300%)), as both the number of shurikens and the damage they deal increases.\nThis means that while Shurikens might not stack well normally, if you find a printer, they can become extremely powerful. At six stacks, the quadratic damage growth will get a very considerable return. However it's still not enough to cancel out the diminishing returns of stacking unless you can find sufficient stacks of Shurikens. Going beyond six stacks can increase your DPS by leaps and bounds.\nShurikens are extremely dangerous if monsters gain them (such as in the   Void Fields, with the Artifact of Evolution enabled, or if the monster is a   Scavenger or the   final boss), as they deal large amounts of damage and are difficult to avoid due to their high velocity. If the monsters also have Kjaro's or Runald's Band, even a single shuriken can kill the player.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Aluminum Throwing Star\n\nTracking Number: 77******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 05/15/2060\n\nShipping Method: Priority\n\nShipping Address: Sensei Dareth's Mojo Dojo, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nFor the last time, shouting \"hiyahh!\" when throwing a shuriken will NOT improve your results.
