    "notes": "The Berzerker's Pauldron is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Glorious Battle Challenge.\nWhen the holder kills 4 enemies in quick succession, they get the   War Cry buff for 6 seconds (+4 seconds per stack), which grants a 50% increase in movement speed and a 100% increase in attack speed. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: All 4 enemies do not have to be killed within 1 second. The Pauldron activates when the player's multikill streak reaches 4 or more, and the streak only resets if 1 second passes without killing an enemy.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nCharacters with powerful crowd control abilities such as   Artificer,   Loader, and   Captain can make much more reliable use of this item.\nItems that deal powerful area damage, such as  Will-o'-the-wisp and  Ukulele, can make activating this item's effect easier.\nAlthough the  Forgive Me Please activates on-kill effects, it alone cannot activate the Berzerker's Pauldron. The doll registers a \"kill\" once per second, which is too slow to maintain a multikill streak on its own. It will still make activating the Pauldron easier, however.\nHaving a  Fuel Cell makes it possible to have 2 dolls active at once, which is sufficient to activate the Berzerker's Pauldron.\nThe War Cry buff does not stack with the   Team War Cry buff from  Gorag's Opus. In fact, the two buffs cannot coexist, so whichever is activated later can overwrite the other. This is important if one has at least a few stacks for a long duration for Berzerker's Pauldron but activates the Gorag's Opus, which will bring down the duration to just 7 seconds.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Antique Pauldron\n\nTracking Number: 58***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 04/05/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Priority\n\nShipping Address: Jungle VII, Museum of 2019, Earth\n\nShipping Details: \n\nAnother antique for the collection. This bad boy was found on the battlefield where much of the War was fought. The excavation site was littered with bones, all surrounding the remains of one rebel soldier, who was carrying this artifact. According to hearsay and rumors, rebel soldiers wearing pauldrons much like this one would enter trances on the battlefield. Time would slow down, and all they could see was the enemy.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s just speculation, but\u2026 There were a lot of bodies surrounding this thing\u2019s old owner.
