    "notes": "Noxious Thorn is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nThe first stack of Noxious Thorn grants a 10% chance to inflict enemies with   Bleed on hit. On kill, 33% of the killed enemy's debuff stacks are transferred to 1 living enemy (+1 per stack) within 20 meters (+5 meters per stack) of where it was killed.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item and  Tri-Tip Dagger both contribute towards the same chance to apply bleed on-hit, and do not roll independently of each other.\nThe amount of debuffs transferred is rounded up. For example, if a killed enemy had less than 3 stacks of a given debuff, 1 stack of the debuff will still be transferred anyway.\nIt transfers stacks of the following debuffs:\n  Bleed\n  Collapse\n  Hemorrhage\n  Burn\n  Stronger Burn\n  Poison\n  Blight\n  Fruiting\n  Weak\n  Expose\n  Lunar Ruin\n  Beetle Juice\n  Overheat\n  Healing Disabled\n  Cripple\n  Pulverize Buildup\n  Pulverized\n  Permanent Armor Reduction\n  Nullify Stack\n  Nullified\n  50% Slow\n  60% Slow\n  80% Slow\n  Tar\n  Death Mark\nThe following debuffs cannot be transferred:\n  Entangle\n  Ruin\n  Lunar Root\n  Permanent Curse\n  Helfire\n  Void Fog\n  Void Fog Strong\n  Breaching Fin Debuff\n  Disable All Skills\n  Soul Cost\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\"Campbell, where did Furthen go?\" \n\"Wanted a \u2019closer look\u2019 at the native fauna. Took Tharson.\" \n\"\u2026Absolute loon. You done yet?\" \nCampbell glares at Andrews, then gasps.\nBehind him dozens of dots climb the sky, growing to clay jars at their apex.\nClay shatters against the camp in a brief violent hail, coating it in yellow ichor and chaos. \n[5 minutes later] \nCampbell snaps awake to a scream cut short by a wet slice. She struggles out from under half of Andrews and gags at the vile smell. Shouting, chiton, gunfire, then silence. \nA limping Beetle approaches, it\u2019s stump leg crunches onto thorns hidden by ichor and it shrieks, convulsing. Campbell screams and fires but her pistol jams with ichor. The Beetle shudders and it\u2019s many small wounds open and turn to sickly, yellow rivers.\nThe Beetle twitches and falls, a splash of its warm blood hits Campbell.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nOld Functionality - 25% chance on being hit to inflict nearby enemies with 2 (+1 per stack) stacks of bleed. If enemies are already inflicted with one or more stackable debuffs, add 1 (+1 per stack) to those debuffs instead.\nUpdated Functionality - Gain 10% chance to bleed an enemy. On killing an enemy, transfer 33% of every debuff stack to 1 enemy (+1 per stack) within 20m (+5m per stack).\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nNoxious Thorn",
