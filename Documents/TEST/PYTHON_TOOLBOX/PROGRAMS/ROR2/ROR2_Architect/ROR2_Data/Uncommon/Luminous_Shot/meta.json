    "notes": "Luminous Shot is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nUpon using a Secondary Skill, the item grants a stack of the Luminous Shot Charge status effect. At 3 or more stacks, the status effect becomes the   Increased Primary Damage buff. One stack of the buff is consumed upon hitting an enemy after using a primary skill, dealing 175% total damage (+50% per item stack). The buff can be stacked up to 5 times (+1 per stack).\nAdditionally, the first stack of Luminous Shot grants 20% secondary skill cooldown reduction.\nEach lighting bolt has a proc coefficient of 1.0\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis point seems to be incorrect for   MUL-T as of the Alloyed Collective update, you can repeatedly trigger the item's effect while holding down   Auto-Nailgun as a primary skill while using   Power Mode, might be the case for other survivors as well. - It is worth to note that the   Increased Primary Damage buff will only trigger if the primary skill was used after gaining the first stack. If the first stack of the buff is acquired during the use of a primary skill, that instance of the the skill will never trigger the buff. This can occur, for example, if any variation of the   Loader grapple is used during a hit of   Knuckleboom but is especially present with skills that can be used indefinitely such as   MUL-T if using   Power Mode in combination with   Power-Saw or   Auto-Nailgun as those skills will not be able to use the buff until completely re-initiated. This effectively means no one instance of a skill will ever be able to use   Increased Primary Damage more than once.\n  Railgunner doesn't actually gain the buff from using the secondary skills but from firing out the transformed primary skill, which also cannot use the buff through any means, forcing her to trigger it through   XQR Smart Round System.\n  MUL-T cannot trigger the lightning strikes in   Power Mode when using two of the same weapon, but using the secondary weapon will still stack the buff.\nThis item is especially strong with  Backup Magazine.\nThe  Shuriken does not trigger the buff.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAs   MUL-T, repeatedly using his second primary skill while in   Power Mode can allow for quick accumulation of buff stacks.\nThis is especially apparent when using   Power-Saw as the second primary skill, giving a stack each time the button to trigger the skill is pressed. This effectively allows the player to stack buffs as quickly as they can press the Secondary button.\nSurvivors that have very low cooldown secondary abilities like   Acrid,   Mercenary and   REX, or multiple uses for secondary abilities like   False Son or   Operator can easily ramp up the stacks.\nIf   Mercenary activates the Luminous Shot hit on an attack that applies   Expose, it will subsequently trigger the effect on its own.\nEven better, if Luminous Shot activates from a hit on an Exposed enemy, the damage of each lightning strike will be based on the Expose-boosted damage. For instance, with one item stack, instead of doing 227.5% damage (130% x 1.75 = 227.5%), each strike will do 840% damage ([130% + 350%] * 1.75 = 480% * 1.75 = 840%).\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Results are in!\nThe 2057 NextTech winner is the Luminous Shot, crafted by Inventor M. Louis VI of Europa.\n\nM. Louis comments on her victory, \u2019Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to progress. Looking forward to next year.\u2019\n\nComing in 2nd, the Preon Accumulator, crafted by Technician Neil Hasting of Earth. Neil comments, \u2019I\u2019m proud of what I submitted, but these fancy Europans put up a good fight, using [REDACTED] tech? How did she even find that? Her cross-weapon sync theory demands respect. See you next year for a rematch, Maggie.\u2019\nThe coup still fresh on Europa\u2019s mind, the new acting government confronts her controversial work on the Crowdfunder, a tool of suppression used by the old monarchy. M. Louis replies to critics, \u2019I take responsibility for the abuse of my invention, I ask that you evaluate my work going forward by how it can help us prevent this kind of tragedy.\u2019\"\n\n - The Saturn Reporter, Technology Section\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nLuminous Shot\nOld Functionality - Using the secondary skill charges the next primary attack, dealing +150% damage (+25% per item stack) per charge up to 5 times (+1 per item stack).\nNew Functionality - Activating Secondary skill stores up to 5 charges (+1 per stack.) Requires 3 charges for your Primary skill to fire lightning strikes, dealing 175% TOTAL damage (+50% per stack) each. Reduces Secondary skill cooldown by 20%.\nRailgunner can no longer build stacks of Luminous Shot by repeatedly using the zoom scope while holding down her primary attack.\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nLuminous Shot",
