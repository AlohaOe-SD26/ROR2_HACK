    "notes": "Prayer Beads is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nThe item passively gains 100% (+25% per item stack) experience alongside the player. Upon reaching a certain threshold, a stack of   Prayer Beads Buff is obtained. Upon removing Prayer Beads from the inventory (through scrappers, printers, or cauldrons), the player will gain 20% (+5% per item stack) of their health, regen, and damage per level for each stack of the buff.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe item gains -2.5% experience for every stack of   Prayer Beads Buff that was previously consumed by the player (via removal of Prayer Beads).\nThe experience gained by this item cannot go below 20% (+5% per item stack).\nIf the player transforms into the   Heretic after removing Prayer Beads, the stat buff granted will use the original survivor's stats instead of the Heretic's. However, transforming before removing the item will make it use the Heretic's stats as expected.\n  Solus Extractors can steal the item from the player, granting the stats upgrade when stolen. Killing them will return the item while retaining the upgrade, allowing a second usage of it.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Shipping details\nOrder: --\nEstimated Delivery: --\nShipping method: --\n\nShipping address:\n--\n\nShipping details:\n--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\"That isn\u2019t regulation, Garcia.\" \n\"tHat iSn\u2019t rEguLation, gArCia\u2026\" \n\"\u2026\" \n\"Well that\u2019s what you sound like.
