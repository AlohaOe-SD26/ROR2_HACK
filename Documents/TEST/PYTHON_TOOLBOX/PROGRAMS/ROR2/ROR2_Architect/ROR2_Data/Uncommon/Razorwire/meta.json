    "notes": "Razorwire is an item introduced in the Hidden Realms Update.\nWhen the holder takes damage, the Razorwire instantly attacks up to 5 (+2 per stack) enemies in a 25m (+10 per stack) radius, dealing 160% damage to each with a proc coefficient of 0.5.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe item will also activate from self-damage sources, such as fall damage or Shrines of Blood.\nWhen incoming damage is blocked by  Tougher Times,  Safer Spaces, or   invincibility, the Razorwire will not trigger.\nThis item is especially useful on   REX since it will trigger upon use of any health-sacrificing ability, and as such is very effective with their   Seed Barrage skill.\nAreas with Void Fog are made significantly easier with this item, as the player can simply take small ticks of damage to continually attack nearby enemies.\nTake care of performing this, as the amount of damage received per tick by the Void Fog increases each hit. The damage increase can be reset by entering a safe zone.\nThe  Helfire Tincture will also activate the Razorwire in a similar fashion. With enough stacks of Razorwire, this can allow for map-wide attacks while the Tincture is active.\nTake care when fighting near explosive pots on Abandoned Aqueduct, as the Razorwire may detonate the pots and kill the player.\nThe razor bursts have a proc coefficient of 0.0 when held by Umbrae spawned by the Artifact of Vengeance.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Custom-made Barbed Wire, 200m\n\nTracking Number: 05***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 02/01/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Priority\n\nShipping Address: PO Box 23-5B, Fort Blondershire, Colony of Man\n\nShipping Details: \n\nYou were right to come to me for this PREMIUM barbed wire. The other retail models won\u2019t get the job done like I do. Just cutting up invaders isn\u2019t enough \u2013 no sir - I built in a secret defense mechanism!\n\nBy cramming as many razors, exacto knives, and any other blade I could find into this thing, this beauty is a powder keg just WAITING to burst! This is my greatest work yet. \n\nIf I don\u2019t get good reviews, expect to hear from my lawyers!\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Razorwire\nBug Fixes\nFixed Razorwire making trail renderers that were not being cleaned up, potentially causing infinite objects in the scene\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item: Razorwire",
