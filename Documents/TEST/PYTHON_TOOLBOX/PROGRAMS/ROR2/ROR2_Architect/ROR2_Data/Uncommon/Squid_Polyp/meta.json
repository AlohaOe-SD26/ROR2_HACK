    "notes": "The Squid Polyp is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Automation Activation Challenge.\nWhen interacting with something (with the exception of  Scrappers and Command Essences), the item summons a Squid Turret with 100% (+100% per stack) attack speed that attacks nearby enemies. Each turret normally lasts 30 seconds.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe 30 second time limit is based on a constant health drain, and as such it can be either extended via healing (e.g.  Bustling Fungus, Shrine of the Woods), or cut short by being damaged.\nSquid turrets have 4 (+0.8 per level) base damage. Their attack fires every 0.75s at base attack speed for 500% damage (effectively 666% damage per second per stack) with a 0.1 Proc Coefficient and applies a knockback effect, pushing away targets with a force of 2000.\nThe turrets' level is based on the ambient run level, so the turrets always spawn at the same level as enemies, not the player's level.\n  Captain's   Beacon: Resupply can activate the Squid Polyp, as the beacon itself is an interactable. Keep in mind that each supply beacon only has 3 uses, so use them wisely.\nNote that Squid Turrets do not get  Defensive Microbots from Captain's passive.\nUse  Gorag's Opus to greatly boost all Squid Turrets' firepower for a short time.\nThis item cannot be obtained in the Simulacrum mode, and will appear locked if attempting to select it with the Artifact of Command.\nThe turret can be possessed by a   Void Infestor, potentially turning it into a considerable danger to a player. Care should be taken when activating a Void Cradle while carrying a Polyp, as it'll always spawn a turret along with possibly several Infestors.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"It\u2019s disgusting.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s only mildly disturbing. You\u2019re overreacting.\"\n\n\"Well, when it turns on us, don\u2019t come crying to me.\"\n\n\"It seems like it wants to only help us, so I\u2019d rather have it close in case that dangerous looking group comes back around.\"\n\n\"I swear there\u2019s more than one. It\u2019s everywhere I look: the storage locker, the food dispenser, the cargo containers, everywhere!\"\n\n\"You\u2019re exaggerating, it\u2019s probably just following you. Snap out of it!\"\n\n\"Ow! Did you just smack me!?\"\n\n\"You were acting hysterical. I had to... Hey, why is that thing looking at me now?\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.4\nSquid Turret Ally Base Damage: 20 \u21d2 4\nSquid Turret Ally Primary Skill Damage Coefficient: 1 \u21d2 5\nSquid Turret Allies Primary Skill Proc Coefficient:  1 \u21d2 0.1\nSquid Turret Allies Primary Skill Knockback Force:  0 \u21d2 2000\nSquid Turret Allies can now be stunned by \u201cstunning\u201d skills\nSquid Turret Allies can now be frozen\nDeveloper Notes: An important part of the balance of the Void Cradles is the risk from the Void Infestors it spawns, so we wanted to lower the risk with Squid Polyp without completely removing it.  These changes to Squid Polyp are overall a slight buff in the hands of the player (the knockback especially defends the turrets against infestation), but they mainly reduce the damage from Collapse when Voidtouched.  And believe it or not, they\u2019re actually pretty good at killing the Void Infestors.\n\nAnniversary Update\nQuality of Life\nUpdate visuals to match other assets\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4892828)\nBug Fixes\nFix an issue with Squid Polyps sometimes spawning underground\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item: Squid Polyp\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Squid Polyp",
