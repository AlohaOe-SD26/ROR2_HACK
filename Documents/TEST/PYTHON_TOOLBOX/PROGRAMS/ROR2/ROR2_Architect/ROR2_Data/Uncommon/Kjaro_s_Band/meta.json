    "notes": "Kjaro's Band is an item in Risk of Rain 2. Its counterpart is  Runald's Band, and they are both unlocked and start appearing in runs after completing the Death Do Us Part Challenge.\nWhen striking an enemy with an attack that deals 400% or more damage, the Band creates a flaming tornado that deals 300% (+300% per stack) total damage. This bonus attack has a cooldown of 10 seconds and a proc coefficient of 0.0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe runic flame tornado hits targets every 0.3s for 3s within ~5m.\nIn addition to dealing at least 400% damage, a hit must have a proc coefficient greater than 0.0 to activate the Bands. Damage bonuses such as critical strikes or  Armor-Piercing Rounds will not cause weaker hits to activate the Bands, even if the final damage dealt is above 400% base damage.\n  Mercenary's signature {  Expose debuff is an exception. When Mercenary hits an Exposed enemy, the hit deals an extra 350% damage, which does count towards the Bands' activation.\nThis item always activates simultaneously with Runald's Band.\nThe cooldown for the Bands can be seen above the player's health bar as a {  status effect with up to 10 stacks. 1 stack is removed every second, and when the last stack is removed the Bands are {  ready and can be activated again.\nBecause this status effect is considered a debuff, activating the  Blast Shower will reset the cooldown immediately.\n Ben's Raincoat does not provide immunity to this debuff.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Should passion die down,\n\nShould light be extinguished,\n\nWill you bring me patience?\n\nWill you die with me?\"\n\n-The Syzygy of Io and Europa\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nRunald\u2019s/Kjaro\u2019s Band  Developer Notes: The two rings have undergone a bit of a rework, working off of an internal cooldown rather than a chance on-hit. We\u2019re hoping that this can help diversify one of our \u201con-hit\u201d items to be more than just attacking enemies and hoping things activate. We\u2019ve also changed the behavior of Kjaro\u2019s to be more of the AoE option, while Runald\u2019s is the single target option.\nProc Chance: 8% \u21d2 100%\nNow has an internal cooldown of 10 seconds\nNow has a minimum threshold of only triggering on attacks that deal 400% or greater damage\nFire Tornado Damage: 500% (+250% per stack) \u21d2 300% (+300% per stack)\nFire Tornado Hitbox Width: 4.8m \u21d2 13m\nNo longer moves\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nDamage: 500% (+250% per stack) additive damage \u21d2 500% (+250% per stack) total damage\nEarly Access Release\nIntroduced as \"8% chance on hit to strike an enemy with a runic flame tornado, dealing 500% additive damage (+250% per stack).\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIt is implied that this item was used as a wedding ring for a pair of   Elder Lemurians.",
