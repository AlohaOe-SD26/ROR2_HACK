    "notes": "The 57 Leaf Clover is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the The Long Road Challenge.\nThe Clover makes random beneficial effects more likely to occur for the holder, and as such is the counterpart to the  Purity (which makes beneficial effects less likely to occur). It affects all random effects except  Tougher Times. \nIf a successful proc is not achieved on a roll, it will be rolled one additional time per Clover. For example, assume the player has one item that has a 20% chance to proc a beneficial effect on-hit, and has one 57 Leaf Clover. If the player attacks, and the item does not activate, the roll will be done once more, as the player has one Clover. \nSuccesses are measured per effect, not as a whole. If one item roll is successful, other items that were triggered by the same proc will continue to roll if unsuccessful.\nSince items from chests are created based on the world seed, the Clover does not affect them.\n\n\n== Math ==\nIn order to calculate proc probability with a certain number of Clovers, the following equation can be used:\ny = 1 - (1 - p)^(x + 1)\nWhere:\n\np = total item proc chance (between 0 and 1)\nx = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.\ny = new item proc chance (between 0 and 1) with x amount of Clovers.\n\nThe inverse of the equation, to find the number of Clovers required to achieve a certain proc probability, is:\nx = (log(1 - y) / log(1 - p)) - 1\nNote that this is a logarithmic equation. As such, it is impossible to achieve 100% proc chance on an effect (regardless of the number of Clovers held), unless the base chance is already 100%.\nIn order to calculate proc probability with a certain number of Clovers and a certain number of times a proc chance is rolled, the following equation can be used:\ny = 1 - ((1 - p)^(x + 1))^t\nWhere:\n\np = total proc chance (between 0 and 1)\nx = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.\nt = the amount of times a proc chance is rolled.\ny = new proc chance (between 0 and 1) with x amount of Clovers and t amount of times the proc chance is rolled.\nThis equation is useful for calculating logbook drop chances for multi-phase bosses, like   Voidling and   Mithrix, or more uncommon enemies, like   Overloading Worms.\n\n\n== Interaction with Purity ==\nIn the game code, the number of Clovers is referred to as \"Luck,\" with each Clover giving +1 Luck. There are no other means of acquiring positive Luck. Negative Luck is also supported, and can be obtained via the lunar item  Purity. Positive and negative Luck will cancel each other out, and thus an equal number of Clovers and Purity will equate to 0 Luck.\nThe game runs a proc chance Abs(Luck) times, where Luck is the total amount after Clovers (positive) & Purities (negative) are applied.\nIf the player has 7 Clovers and 5 Purity, the 5 Purity will cancel out 5 of the Clovers, resulting in a net +2 Luck. This means any given proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a positive outcome. If the amount of each item is switched, resulting in -2 Luck, the proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a negative outcome; this can also be seen as the proc chance needing to successfully roll three times for it to proc (once for the initial roll and two more for each negative Luck).\n\n\n== Exhaustive List of Clover Effects ==\nLuck does not affect chest spawns or contents, Shrine of Chance outcomes, the chance for an  Artifact Key to drop, or the chance for monsters to drop items with the Artifact of Sacrifice enabled.\n\n\n=== Survivor Effects ===\nCritical strike chance. Survivors have a base 1.0% critical strike chance.\n  Artificer's chance to   Burn with   Flamethrower (50% base chance).\n  Heretic's chance to inflict   Ruin on hit (base chance is equal to the proc coefficient of the damage).\n\n\n=== Item Effects ===\n Lens-Maker's Glasses' chance to critical hit.\n Stun Grenade's chance to stun a target.\n Tri-Tip Dagger's chance to   Bleed a target.\n Sticky Bomb's chance to attach a sticky bomb.\n Ukulele's chance to fire chain lightning.\n AtG Missile Mk. 1's chance to fire a missile.\n Bandolier's chance to drop an ammo pack.\n Ghor's Tome's chance to drop a gold nugget.\n Sale Star's chance to grant additional items.\n Chance Doll's chance to replace the Shrine of Chance loot table.\n Sentient Meat Hook's chance to hook enemies.\n Happiest Mask's chance to spawn a ghost.\n Electric Boomerang's chance to fire a boomerang.\n Runic Lens' chance to summon a meteor.\n Sonorous Whispers' chance to drop an item on Elite kill.\n Molten Perforator's chance to fire magma balls.\n Charged Perforator's chance to summon a lightning bolt.\n Saut\u00e9ed Worms' chance to summon a spectral worm.\n Brittle Crown's chance to gain gold.\n Spinel Tonic's chance to get a  Tonic Affliction. A single Clover reduces the chance from 20% to 4%.\n Lost Seer's Lenses' chance to instantly kill.\n Needletick's chance to inflict   Collapse.\n Polylute's chance to barrage an enemy with lightning.\n Tentabauble's chance to inflict   Nullified.\n\n\n=== Gameplay Effects ===\nMonster log drop chance.\nElite equipment drop chance.\n\n\n=== Monster Effects ===\nIf a monster acquires critical strike chance, this chance is affected by any Clovers it has. Monsters have 0% base critical strike chance.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nIt was a massacre. The orbital probes had incinerated both the battalion and the enemy\u2013 as well as the entire plateau. There was no life left to be found - except for one lone soldier.\n\nThe soldier trudged through the scorched plains, numbly looking for any survivors.\n\nBut he found none.\n\nThe soldier tried to find water \u2013 he had only just noticed how thirsty he was, and how much his head hurt. How much his heart hurt.\n\nBut he found none.\n\nThe soldier tried to remember, why he was out on this terrible mission, and why he had to say goodbye to so many.\n\nBut he found none.\n\nThe soldier tried to find anything \u2013 anything that could justify why he was alive. Some semblance of meaning \u2013 or hope.\n\nAnd he found one.\n\nA small leaf, peeking out from a pile of ash. He gently plucked the clover out of the ground \u2013 somehow, it survived hours of orbital bombardments. \n\nWith clover in hand, the soldier began the long trek to report back to his superiors. Was this divine intervention? Was there some meaning \u2013 some reason as to why both him and this little clover survived? \n\nOr were they just lucky?\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: 57 Leaf Clover\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe 57 Leaf Clover is the successor to the 56 Leaf Clover from the first Risk of Rain. The 56 Leaf Clover did not interact with chance effects, but instead gave a chance for Elite monsters to drop random items upon defeat.\nThis behavior is partially carried over to Risk of Rain 2, as the 57 Leaf Clover affects the chance for Elite monsters to drop their Elite equipment.\nBefore the Artifacts update, the unreleased code for the Artifact of Sacrifice would check for the Luck of the killer. This is no longer the case.\nBefore the full release of Risk of Rain 2,  Runald's Band and  Kjaro's Band were affected by the Luck stat, and therefore were more likely to proc when the player had a Clover. This is no longer the case, as the 1.0 update revamped both Bands.\nAn interesting leftover of this design change is that Kjaro and Runald, the two   Elder Lemurians who spawn with the Bands in the   Abandoned Aqueduct, also both spawn with 20 stacks of 57 Leaf Clovers.\nFor every frame that the Clover's effect is triggered at least once, a chime sound can be heard. This is hard to notice when striking an enemy, but it can also be triggered when the player takes damage while holding a  Razorwire, since the item will roll for critical strike before searching for valid targets. As such, being under the effect of the   Void Fog makes this more noticeable.",
