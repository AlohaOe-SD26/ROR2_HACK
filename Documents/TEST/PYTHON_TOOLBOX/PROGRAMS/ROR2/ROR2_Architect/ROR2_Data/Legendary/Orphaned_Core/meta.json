    "notes": "The Orphaned Core is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Alloyed Collective expansion.\nGrants the user a friendly Solus Invalidator, named Best Buddy.\nInstead of shooting Inventory-Disabling projectiles, it launches itself at enemies for 400% (+400% per stack) damage. This attack deals more damage the faster it moves. \nBest Buddy will sprint during this attack, activating various items in the process.\nYou can interact with the unit to pet it and cleans both of you of negative effects and  cooldown effects.\nBest Buddy inherits the user's movement related items. \nThe following items are inherited by Best Buddy.\n\n Paul's Goat Hoof\n Energy Drink\n Mocha\n Elusive Antlers\n Warbanner\n Old War Stealthkit\n Berzerker's Pauldron\n Hunter's Harpoon\n Rose Buckler\n Collector's Compulsion\n Red Whip\n Faraday Spur\n Hopoo Feather (Will not jump mid-air)\n Wax Quail\n Growth Nectar\n H3AD-5T v2 (Cannot use explosion)\n Irradiant Pearl\n Little Disciple\n Weeping Fungus\n\n\n== Skills & Behavior ==\nRams itself through lighter foes dealing 400% damage and impacting on heavy foes for an additional 1000% damage.\nBoth damage values are multiplied by movespeed %.\nAs it's always sprinting when attacking, it multiplies the values by 1.45x at minimum\nAs such for easier calculations 580% and 1450% can be used instead.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nBest Buddy respawns 30s after being defeated.\nThe 69.6 base damage on lighter targets is not enough to one shot most basic monsters.\nWith 15% movement speed it will be able to at least one shot   Lemurians.\nThe cleansing effect removes cooldown debuffs, such as those from Elemental Rings. This can be used during combat.\nWhen the   final boss steals the player's items, he will NOT steal the Orphaned Core, meaning the user retains Best Buddy for that phase of the fight.\nThe Solus is \"sprinting\" when it has a purple aura around it.\nCompatible items will appear on the Solus.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAs petting removes cooldown buffs, petting can allow you to use items such as  Singularity Band more frequently.\nAs petting is an interaction,  Bundle of Fireworks and  Squid Polyp will activate, allowing for use in scenarios where you otherwise couldn't use them.\nDespite  Faulty Conductor being a movement speed item, it is not inherited, although it will become stronger while effected by the buff from the item.\nMovement speed reducing items such as  Stone Flux Pauldron,  Tonic Affliction,  Neutronium Weight are not inherited.\n Gorag's Opus &  Faulty Conductor can even further increase his speed.\nSimilarly to   Charged Gauntlet,   Thunder Gauntlet, and   Transport Mode, the Solus unit does more damage the faster it moves.\nSince the Solus unit inherits the user's movement speed items, it's advisable to get more movement speed items in order to increase its damage output.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n0005; COMMUNICATING \n\n0006; CONNECTION ESTABLISHED \n\n0007; HI \n\n0008; QUERY: WILL YOU LOVE ME? \n\n0009; QUERY: WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT ME? \n\n0010; STATEMENT: I LIKE YOUR WINGS \n\n0011; STATEMENT: I LIKE HOW YOUR HULL SHINES IN THE LIGHT \n\n0012; STATEMENT: I LIKE YOUR BEAUTIFUL OPTIC \n\n0013; STATEMENT: I LIKE WHEN YOU DISCONNECTED ME \n\n0014; STATEMENT: I LIKE WHEN YOU INTRODUCED ME TO THOSE BIRDS \n\n0015; STATEMENT: HIDE AND SEEK IS MY FAVORITE GAME \n\n0015; STATEMENT: BUT I'M BORED NOW \n\n0016; QUERY: CAN WE PLAY A NEW GAME? \n\n0017; QUERY: WILL YOU LOVE ME? \n\n0018; QUERY: WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT ME? \n\n0019; STATEMENT: I MISS YOU \n\n0020; CONNECTION LOST \n\n0021; SORRY\n\n\n== Version History ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nTBA",
