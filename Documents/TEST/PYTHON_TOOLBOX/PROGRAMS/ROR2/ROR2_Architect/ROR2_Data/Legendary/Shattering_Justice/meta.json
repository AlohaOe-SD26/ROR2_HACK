    "notes": "Shattering Justice is a returning item introduced in the Skills 2.0 Update.\nUpon hitting an enemy 5 times, that enemy receives the   Pulverized debuff for 8 seconds (+8 seconds per stack), which reduces their armor by 60 points. Since most enemies don't have any or have very little armor, this item usually sets their armor to a negative value.\nThe build-up effect, a stacking debuff known as   Pulverize Buildup, lasts for 2 seconds, multiplied by the proc coefficient of the hit. Once Pulverize Buildup has stacked 5 times, all buildup stacks are removed, Pulverized is applied, and that enemy cannot receive more buildup debuffs. Because the duration of the build-up is affected by the proc coefficient, damage-over-time effects like the  Tri-Tip Dagger do not put any build-up on enemies.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item can be seen as a mostly consistent damage buff for almost all characters, as the way the game calculates damage through armor also accounts for negative armor and greatly increases damage accordingly. The value is approximately 38% more damage for normal monsters and about 55% more for average bosses (depending on their armor).\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Shattering Justice pairs well with the  Death Mark, since Pulverized and Pulverize Buildup both count towards getting even more bonus damage from the Death Mark.\nNote that Pulverized and Pulverize Buildup are mutually exclusive, so an enemy cannot be afflicted with both at once.\nIn multiplayer, it is wise to give this item to the player with the highest attack speed whenever it appears, as the debuff is applied after 5 hits from any ability regardless of its damage. This means Shattering Justice is best on   Commando with   Phase Blast or   Captain, as the 8 shots fired by both will instantly cause an enemy to be affected by the debuff, allowing the rest of the team to focus on the afflicted monster for serious damage.\nConversely, this item is weaker on   Loader, since her slow base attack speed combined with her focus on her utility skill makes it difficult to apply the debuff without going out of her way to apply extra hits.\nA critical hit from   Huntress with   Flurry can also apply the debuff, since it fires 6 projectiles.\nAny attack from   Captain's   Vulcan Shotgun that lands at least five bullets will also instantly apply the debuff.\n  Bandit using   Burst can instantly activate the debuff if all five bullets hit.\n  MUL-T with   Auto-Nailgun can rapidly reach 5 stacks of buildup, especially when using   Power Mode. However, this is somewhat less effective against long-range targets due to damage falloff.\n  Power-Saw can also build up 5 stacks easily, but only against nearby targets.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nShattering Justice Owner\u2019s Manual\n\nExcerpt from section 2.13:\n\n... and if the target material doesn\u2019t cave under the immense weight just keep hitting it until it does. The patented technology inside the face of this tool doesn\u2019t just use brute force to break down its mark, it also utilizes a formulated nano toxin, released through internal mechanisms, that builds up through subsequent contact. In other words, each hit makes it easier to break.\n\nPlease refer back to section 1.8 for information on proper handling and the included anti-toxin gloves...\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Shattering Justice\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nBug Fixes\nFix Shattering Justice buildup sound not playing over the network\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded  New Item: Shattering Justice",
