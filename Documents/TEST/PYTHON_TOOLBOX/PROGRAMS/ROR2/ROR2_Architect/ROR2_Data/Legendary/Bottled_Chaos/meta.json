    "notes": "Bottled Chaos is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nWhen the holder activates their equipment, they also activate 1 (+1 per stack) effect of another random equipment.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCertain equipment effects are blacklisted and cannot be called by the Bottled Chaos. These are the:\n Glowing Meteorite\n Helfire Tincture\n Effigy of Grief\n Spinel Tonic\n The Crowdfunder\n Milky Chrysalis\n Recycler\n Fuel Array\n Executive Card\n Trophy Hunter's Tricorn\n Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed).\n Seed of Life (Consumed).\nThe Bottled Chaos will still trigger when using these equipment, however.\nNote that The Crowdfunder cannot trigger the Bottled Chaos, since it is not truly \"activated\" in the way other equipment are.\nBottled Chaos can activate  Seed of Life, often this will result in nothing happening. But can revive all players in multiplayer.\nYour equipment will not be consumed in the process.\nEquipment that have special activation conditions will still activate the Bottled Chaos when those conditions are met; for instance, if the player has an Executive Card, the Bottled Chaos will trigger whenever the player buys something with gold.\nThe Bottled Chaos can call the  Volcanic Egg, so exercise some caution when activating equipment, as the Volcanic Egg can greatly disrupt movement. Using the  Gesture of the Drowned makes this even more likely.\nWhen the Bottled Chaos activates, a shadowy outline of it briefly appears above the holder's head.\nWhen the Bottled Chaos activates, it gathers all acceptable equipment in a list, shuffles them and activates them in order. If an equipment fails to be activated, e.g.,  Forgive Me Please and  Goobo Jr. having reached the cap limit, or  Royal Capacitor,  Eccentric Vase, and  Remote Caffeinator not aiming at a valid target/surface, the activation will not be counted. Additionally, the user's current equipment is removed and added at the end of this list, so that its effect will not be among the first few ones.\nThis means in order to have a duplicate random equipment activated, the activator must have enough stacks of the item to cycle through the whole list.\nRemoving and adding the user's current equipment means that a blacklisted equipment can be activated if the user has enough stacks of this item. Most of these will either fail to activate or just refresh the current equipment's effect duration, for which no time has passed anyway.\nKeep in mind the user cannot kill two lined up bosses with  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn because the equipment is instantly transformed into its consumed version before Bottled Chaos' effect is activated.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe one planet they couldn't take.\n\nThey had everything locked away in their cells.\n\nBeasts, artifacts of power, gods, memories.\n\nAnd yet, no matter how many agents they sent, none returned victorious... if they returned at all.\n\nThe lucky ones who did survive fled, nervously whispering of a crystalline blade stained with chaos.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Bottled Chaos\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe \"crystalline blade\" mentioned in the item's lore is referring to the sword wielded by Providence.\nThis suggests that void monsters had previously tried to invade Petrichor V but were driven away by Providence, explaining why no void enemies appeared in Risk of Rain 1. However, once Providence was killed, because   Mithrix was trapped on the moon, the void monsters could begin their invasion of the planet.",
