    "notes": "The Pocket I.C.B.M. is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nThis item causes all missile-related items, equipment, and skills to fire two more missiles per missile, tripling the number of missiles fired. Additional stacks do not increase the number of missiles fired further, but instead increase missile damage by 50% (+50% per stack) total damage.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe following items are affected by the Pocket I.C.B.M.:\n\n Bundle of Fireworks\n AtG Missile Mk. 1\n Plasma Shrimp\n War Bonds\nThe extra missiles fired only deal 50% Total damage.\n Disposable Missile Launcher\nThe following skills are affected by the Pocket I.C.B.M.:\n\n  Engineer's   Thermal Harpoons\n  Missile Drone's   Missile Barrage\nIncluding   Operator's    ADMIN-OVERRIDE\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Pocket I.C.B.M. can pair very well with a  Soulbound Catalyst and  Disposable Missile Launcher, as it can dramatically increase the Launcher's damage capabilities while quickly becoming available once again with the Soulbound Catalyst.\nCombining the  Bundle of Fireworks with the  Remote Caffeinator for on-demand fireworks becomes even more effective with the Pocket I.C.B.M., allowing the player to purchase healing soda while generating huge amounts of homing fireworks.\nEvery individual missile lock of   Engineer's   Thermal Harpoons is affected by this item, resulting in the number of missiles being tripled regardless of volley size.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"What's better than one missile...? MORE missiles. Easy, just fire a bunch of the things and reduce whatever you're fighting to a smoldering field of craters. Enemy nation? Missiles. Stupid bird taunting you? Missiles. Family argument going south? That's right - missiles! There's nothing a missile can't do, and what little the missile can't get done, a bunch of them can.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Hey, um, maybe we should edit this out? Cluster bombs are still banned according to the geneva conventions... And urging people to nuke their family members PROBABLY won't go over well with the target audience.\n\nThe Autobiography of Jans Czar, Modern King of Weaponry, First Draft\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Pocket I.C.B.M.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Jans Czar quoted in this item's logbook entry is also quoted in the entry for the  Brilliant Behemoth.\nThis item is likely a spiritual successor to the AtG Missile Mk. 2 from the first Risk of Rain game, which was a legendary item that gave a chance to fire 3 missiles on hit.\nI.C.B.M stands for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.",
