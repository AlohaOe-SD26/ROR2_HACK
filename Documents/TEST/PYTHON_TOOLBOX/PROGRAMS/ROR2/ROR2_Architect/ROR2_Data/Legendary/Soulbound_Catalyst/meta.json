    "notes": "The Soulbound Catalyst is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Newtist Challenge.\nWhen the holder kills an enemy, the cooldown for their held equipment instantly decreases by 4 seconds (+2 seconds per stack).\n\n\n== Effective limit ==\nThe following amount of stacks of Soulbound Catalyst is needed to instantly recharge equipment on kill.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe  Fuel Array,  The Crowdfunder,  Executive Card,  Seed of Life's self-revive, and the Elite Equipment do not have cooldowns, and thus do not benefit from Soulbound Catalyst.\nDestroying clay pots or bar will count towards the cooldown reduction.\nKills scored by   Engineer's   Turrets will not reduce Engineer's equipment cooldown.\nUsing this item with the  Forgive Me Please reduces its cooldown by a total of 32 seconds over a period of 8 seconds. This allows the player to activate the Forgive Me Please equipment every 5 seconds.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Soulbound Catalyst\n\nTracking Number: 890*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 11/06/2056\n\nShipping Method: High Priority/Fragile\n\nShipping Address: 1414 Place, Fillmore, Venus\n\nShipping Details:\n\nIf you thought the ring was a rare find, wait until you get your hands on this!\n\nIt turns out the method the King used did not originate from his time period. His court discovered a ritual performed by a tribe from much further back. It, of course, dealt with sacrifice, but in substantial groups. This was supposed to concentrate the catalyzing properties of the item it was imbued into.\n\nPayment will be at least twice as much as our previous deal. We can discuss it later - another night.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Soulbound Catalyst\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nBug Fixes\n\u2602 Update the rotation of Soulbound Catalyst on   MUL-T to no longer be upside down\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe shape of the skull is a reference to Reaper from another Hopoo game, DEADBOLT.\nThe phrase from the logbook entry, \"another night\", may also be referencing DEADBOLT, as the same phrase serves as an introduction to the protagonist.\nThe phrase \"if you thought the ring was a rare find\" is in reference to the Wicked Ring from Risk of Rain 1. The Wicked Ring functions similarly to the Soulbound Catalyst, but it reduces all cooldowns upon landing a critical hit.",
