    "desc": "Increase jump height . Creates a 5m-100m radius kinetic explosion on hitting the ground, dealing 1000%-10000% base damage that scales up with fall distance . Recharges in 10 (-50% per stack) seconds.",
    "notes": "The H3AD-5T v2 is an item in Risk of Rain 2.\nWhile mid-air, you can begin charging a ground slam by holding [Interact] key (default \"E\" on keyboard). This will cause you to fall much faster than normal, and upon hitting the ground, they create an explosion whose damage and size scale with the distance they fell. The damage and radius ranges from 1000%-10000% & 5m-100m. Afterwards the explosion takes 10 seconds (-50% per stack) to recharge. \nIt will try to automatically lock onto a enemy if one is underneath you while you do this.\nWhile the explosive ability is ready, the H3AD-5T v2 also increases the player's jump height by roughly 400%. \nThis is not done by changing your stats, instead doubling your upward velocity when leaving the ground, which makes it much more influenced by the angle of the floor, and other items.\nAdditionally, the H3AD-5T v2 negates all fall damage taken, regardless of whether the explosive ability is ready or not.\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\nIdle\nWhile idle, the [interact] button must be held down for at least 0.25 seconds before transitioning to the charge state.\nCharge:\nWhile in the charge state, the input must be held for another 0.6 seconds to enter the fall state. Letting go will return back to the idle state. Entering the charge state will decelerate towards 1 m/s vertically at an acceleration of 30.\nLetting go of the input before entering the fall state can be used to extend the distance of some horizontal jumps slightly.\nFall:\nWhile in the fall state, the user will initially fall downwards at 30 m/s, with an acceleration at a rate of 100m/s2 with a max fall speed of 500 m/s.\nThe minimum distance must be greater than the starting position, so the user won't cause the impact while grounded or very close to grounded.\nIf there is an enemy below within 300m, then the user will be slowly moved towards its position while falling.\nImpact\nThe impact has a minimum damage coefficient of 10 (1000%) and a maximum of 100 (10,000%), with a radius scaling from 5m to 100m. To reach maximum damage, the user must fall for 150m.\nThis impact can crit, and knocks enemies back with an outward force of 200 * scalingDamageCoefficient and a vertical force of 2000. This explosion suffers from Sweet Spot falloff.\nThis blast has a proc coefficient of 1.0.\nIf the user somehow loses all stacks of H3AD-5T v2 mid-fall, the impact will not occur.\nThe user's velocity is set to zero on impact.\nAfter impact, it transitions to the cooldown state.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item is highly effective with   Artificer's   Ion Surge, as she can gain as much height as desired before slamming down, maximizing damage.\n  Loader can also make good use of it, by using her grapple and punch to move vertically.\n  Captain can use his   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike to launch himself high into the air, allowing him to slam back down with the H3AD-5T v2. However, he will have very low health afterwards.\nEquipping a  Milky Chrysalis,  Volcanic Egg, or  Eccentric Vase gives the player  vertical mobility.\nDue to the way collisions work in the game, mobility and movement speed items (particularly the  Wax Quail) coincide well with H3AD-5T v2. With sufficient horizontal speed, running and jumping into the bottom of a slope will send the player flying into the air, enabling survivors to gain elevation over enemies.\nWith some finesse,   Mercenary and   Acrid can achieve a similar effect by ricocheting off slopes (Mercenary with   Whirlwind, and Acrid with either   Caustic Leap or   Frenzied Leap).\nThis item combines well with  Runald's Band,  Kjaro's Band and  Singularity Band, as they are activated when the player deals base damage higher than 400%. H3AD-5T v2 always meets this requirement. Moreover, this has the potential to be the second most powerful damage source of the entire game, making it an ideal match for items based on total damage.\nBecause a target is acquired and locked into whenever possible,  Focus Crystal is almost always activated. The stacking of crystals alongside  Delicate Watch,  Armor-Piercing Rounds, and  Crowbar will allow most enemies to be quickly killed.\nThe  Faraday Spur pairs very well with this item as fully charging  Faraday Spur will launch you very high up and get a powerful slam.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe cooldown is determined by the formula f(x)=10/x, with x being the amount of H3AD-5T v2.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Denizens of lower-gravity planets like Mercury historically have had trouble adjusting to life on other planets. Mercurians, with their lower bone density (left) would typically shatter their femur within a week on heavier planets. Members of asteroid-rigged flotillas and colony ships have similar issues when arriving home from space.\n\nThe invention of Kinetic Dispersion Rings (above) help alleviate the stress of heavier-than-normal gravity by converting kinetic energy into heat, sound, and light. Settlers from Mercury could finally leave their home planet in safety.\"\n\n-Mercurian History Museum\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.4\nBug Fixes\nFixed the landing blast for H3AD-5T v2 not activating from non-host players\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nBug Fixes\nFixed   Loader\u2019s   Thunder Slam not working in conjunction with H3AD-ST\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Now calculates damage from distance traveled, not speed on impact  Developer Notes: Even though this makes less sense from a physics standpoint, it will align better with player expectations. Super long fall = big boom.\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nReworked logic for calculating fall speed so it scales better while falling farther. Now has the following behavior:\nDamage Coefficient: 1000% - 10,000% at maximum speed\nExplosion Radius: 5m - 100m at maximum speed\nImproved FX\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4233443)\nGameplay Changes\nNow activates by holding \"Use\" (E key by default)\nImprove consistency of bonus falling damage\nNow shows little lights when ready\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe H3AD-5T v2's name and effects are a reference to the Headstompers from the first Risk of Rain, which work similarly but do not cause an explosion or negate fall damage.",
