    "notes": "The Resonance Disc is an item introduced in the Hidden Realms Update.\nWhen the holder kills an enemy, they get a stack of {  charge for 7 seconds. When they have 4 stacks of charge, the Disc removes all charge and launches itself at an enemy. It pierces enemies as it flies, dealing 300% damage (+300% per stack) to each, before exploding for 1000% damage (+1000% per stack). Finally, the Disc returns to the user, once again piercing all enemies and dealing 300% damage (+300% per stack) along the way. \nAll these hits have a proc coefficient of 1.0.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nDestroying clay pots or explosive barrels will charge the Resonance Disc.\nHowever, the Disc can also target and attack them, which can waste its attack and prove fatal if the player is in close proximity to one.\nActivating the  Forgive Me Please will charge the Resonance Disc.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Turbine Configuration Wizard Disc\n\nTracking Number: 64***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 08/23/2056\n\nShipping Method:  High Priority\n\nShipping Address: 73421, Calorum St., Saturn\n\nShipping Details: \n\nOops, so sorry! I forgot to include the installation wizard with your new turbine. Thanks so much for letting me know. Who knows what could have happened if you didn\u2019t configure the turbine prior to installation? Always make sure to run the diagnostics on this disc every few weeks \u2013 it\u2019ll help with the turbine\u2019s longevity.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nQuality of Life\nCharge Buff Duration: 5s \u21d2 7s\nUpdated Logbook description for more detailed explanation\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Resonance Disc\nGameplay Changes\nRedo firing logic to be more understandable\nNow grants 1 stacking buff per kill, lasting 5 seconds\nNow fires the Disk at 4 stacks, resetting all stacks\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item: Resonance Disc\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Resonance Disc is the successor to the Laser Turbine from the first Risk of Rain, and is actually referred to as laserTurbine internally.\nThe Logbook entry also mentions a turbine, presumably the Laser Turbine, and indicates that the Resonance Disc was to be sent to the same mailing address as the Laser Turbine.\nBefore the Anniversary Update, the math for Resonance Disc was more complex.\nWhile holding the Resonance Disc, kills generates 2.5 spin, visible by the dot in the model flying around. Spin decays over time. Every 1/60th of a second, Spin = previous spin - (1.25 * time since last kill in seconds). In short, spin decays faster the more time passes between kills.\nSpin, in turn, generates charge. Charge does not decay. At 100% charge, the Resonance Disc checks all enemies within the blast radius of its nearest target to see if it can hit more enemies by targeting one of them instead. After selecting a target, it will fire according to the earlier description.\nHow much charge is generated from spin is dependent on time since the last kill, and the current spin used as a vertical velocity with -0.0125  gravity (so upwards).",
