    "notes": "Ben's Raincoat is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void update.\nIf the holder has any stacks of this item, most debuffs they would receive are completely negated. When this happens, a visual effect of a raincoat will be briefly displayed over the Survivor and the item will go on a 5 second internal cooldown, represented by the   Debuff Immunity Cooldown debuff. Negating a debuff also gives the holder 10% barrier. After the cooldown is over, the buff will be replaced with the   Debuff Immunity buff, indicating debuffs can be negated again.\nThe holder can negate 1 (+1 per stack) debuff before Ben's Raincoat goes on cooldown.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nBen's Raincoat only negates timed Debuffs.\n  Permanent Curse and   Permanent Armor Reduction are not negated because they do not expire.\n  Void Fog and   Void Fog Strong are also not negated because they are technically not debuffs. Even if they were to be blocked, it would not prevent the damage which is caused by a controller. (See Void Fog for more details on this mechanic)\nThe  Spinel Tonic's  Tonic Afflictions are also not prevented, since they are items and not a debuff.\nBen's Raincoat can prevent   Disable All Skills from Prime Devastator ONLY when   Debuff Immunity is active, if   False Son manages to apply   Disable All Skills while Ben's Raincoat is on cooldown, debuff won't be cleansed.\nUnlike the  Blast Shower, Ben's Raincoat does not prevent cooldown debuffs, such as   Elemental Rings Cooldown and   Safer Spaces Cooldown.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nReturn: Gorton Men's Rain Jacket (Medium, Yellow)\n\nTracking Number: 73***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 03/04/2053\n\nShipping Method:  Standard\n\nShipping Address: 545 Matthaios Blvd., Gloucester, Earth\n\nReason For Return: \n\nThe jacket itself is fine, but for some reason, a bunch of the students here got super weird about me wearing it. They keep telling me to take it off because this other guy, Ben, wears a yellow jacket. I guess it's kinda his thing or something.\n\nRefund:\nReplace:  X\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nPlease send a replacement that's blue.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.3.0\nGameplay Changes\nRework behavior - Now has an internal cooldown of 5 seconds\nNow blocks 1 (+1 per stack) debuffs before going on cooldown\nNow grants 10% of your health as barrier when blocking a debuff\nNow has the \u2018Healing\u2019 tag\nNo longer grants maximum health\n\ud83c\udf27 No longer blocks non-timed debuffs, like Eclipse 8 and skills like Power Mode  Developer Notes: Ben\u2019s Raincoat was a very binary item, resulting in unsatisfying stacking behavior and frustrations when given to monsters (like in Simulacrum). The item also trivialized Eclipse 8. Now, it has a bit of downtime for when it can block debuffs - and since we didn\u2019t want this to be just a net nerf, we also added a large barrier when blocking a debuff with the coat.\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Ben's Raincoat\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item is named after Ben Schofield, a senior programmer for Hopoo Games.",
