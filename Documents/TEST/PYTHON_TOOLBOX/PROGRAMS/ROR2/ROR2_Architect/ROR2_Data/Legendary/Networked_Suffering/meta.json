    "notes": "Networked Suffering is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Alloyed Collective expansion.\nWhen the user damages the first 4 (+2 per stack) enemies, it infects them with a computer virus. 45% of all damage done to infected enemies are added to a global damage pool, and every 3 seconds, all infected enemies take 100% of the damage in the global damage pool. The damage pool is then reset to 0.\nThe computer virus counts as a debuff.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nALL get added multiplied and sent to the pool including: Teammates, Minions & damage with 0 proc coeff like damage over time effects.\nInfected enemies glow a green colour, and a green line will be drawn from the player to the infected enemies.\n Noxious Thorn can spread the debuff, however it will not remember who owns the debuff.\nAs such monsters will not drop gold or activate on kills, but also not count towards the debuff application limit.\nThis was confirmed to not be a bug.\nLooking at an infected enemy will show a green number next to their health, representing the current damage in the global damage pool.\nWhen this number starts flashing red, it means that the current number in the damage pool is about to damage all infected enemies.\nThe debuff lasts indefinitely on enemies, meaning that once the user has reached the maximum number of enemies infected, they cannot infect other enemies unless they gain another stack of the item, or one of the infected enemies dies.\nThe damage from the pooled damage does not have a proc coefficient, meaning it will not trigger items such as  Tri-Tip Dagger or  AtG Missile Mk. 1.\nThe damage does not trigger critical strikes.\nThe computer virus requires a damage source with a proc coefficient higher than 0 in order to infect enemies.\nThis means that damage sources like  Brilliant Behemoth's explosion,  Kjaro's Band's fire tornado and   Captain's   Orbital Supply Beacon's impact do not infect uninfected enemies.\nThere is no distance limit for the debuff.\nThe debuff is applied permanently, meaning you will have to kill infected enemies to regain stock.\nThis can be a huge problem if monsters obtain this item, such as when   the Final Boss steals your items, as you will remain infected until your death or next stage.\nAs it is a permament debuff, it cannot be cleansed with a  Blast Shower or  Orphaned Core.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nSince the computer virus is a debuff, it counts towards  Death Mark, making the debuff easier to get.\nThe item synergizes very well with Area of Effect (AOE) items, helping both to kill the infected enemies faster and to spread the virus.\nAny item or skill that deals damage and has a proc coefficient greater than 0 will spread the virus, with respect to the item's current infected enemies limit. The following are examples of items that can spread the virus:\n Bundle of Fireworks\n Will-o'-the-wisp's explosion\n Ukulele's chain lightning\n AtG Missile Mk. 1's missiles, and by extension  Plasma Shrimp\n Noxious Thorn\n Faraday Spur's explosion\n Sentient Meat Hook's hooks\n Runic Lens' meteor\n Remote Caffeinator's impact\nAlthough the item synergizes well with AOE items, it still proves helpful with single-target damage, as it effectively does a burst of 45% of the damage you've done over the 3 second duration.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted]--//\n\n\"So, like, hear me out...\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You know how we're having the problem of drones not being able to tell when another drone breaks? Raising null refs and everything?\"\n\n\"...Yeah...?\"\n\n\"I think I got the answer.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's hear it.\"\n\n\"Why don't we... network their pain and suffering?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.4.1\nDamage shared from Networked Suffering reduced from 50% - > 45%.\nAlloyed Collective\nAdded New Item: Networked Suffering",
