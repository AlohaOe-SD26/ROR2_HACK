    "notes": "Runic Lens is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nWhen the holder hits an enemy, there is a 3% chance to summon a meteor on the target which deals 2000% base damage. For every 100% damage dealt by the initial hit, the meteor has a 3% (+3% per stack) higher chance to summon and will deal an extra 150% damage (+50% per stack) if summoned.\nThe meteor has a proc coefficient of 0.5\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item's damage is capped at 7500%.\nAt 1 stack, this cap gets hit by attacks that deal 3700% damage or more.\nAt 2 stack, 2800% damage or more.\nThis item's proc chance is capped at 75%\nAt 1 stack, this cap gets hit by attacks that deal 2400% damage or more.\nAt 2 stack, 1200% damage or more.\nOnly one meteor per player/NPC can exist at the same time.\nAlthough proc chains that proc the meteor cannot trigger it again, the meteor itself does not carry over previous proc chain information. This makes it possible to re-trigger earlier procs in the chain. For example, the meteor and  AtG Missile Mk. 1 can end up in an infinite feedback loop. This is most likely a bug.\nRelatedly, the   SureProc buff bestowed by  Deus Ex Machina is not transferred to a proc chain after a Runic Lens meteor, meaning the meteor isn't guranteed to proc anything. This can cause wildy inconsistent damage output because of the limit of 1 meteor being active at a time.\nThe data about the meteor's target, damage, and impending impact are tied to the attacker's body. If this character's body is destroyed before the meteor lands, there will be no blast. The visual ring surrounding the target and implying the meteor is coming is an independent visual effect which does not trigger the explosion.\nBody destruction in this case is quite literal. When a character is killed, the body object persists for a little longer to perform its death animation, during which time the meteor can still land successfully. However, respawning destroys the old body and creates a new one.\nDespite the meteor visual, only the explosion on impact with the ground deals damage. Therefore, Runic Lens won't be able to damage airborne enemies that are too far from the ground.\n Breaching Fin is an anti-synergy as it will often knock enemies out of the blast area.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nHeavy hitting abilities like   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike, items like  H3AD-5T v2 and equipment like  Royal Capacitor and  Preon Accumulator all have very high damage coefficient, allowing the player to get more value out of Runic Lens by increasing the chances of it proccing and the damage it does.\n  OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike is the only base damage source of damage that can hit the cap on both proc chance and damage,  H3AD-5T v2 being extremely close but falling a little short.\nCrowd control items and skills such as  Sentient Meat Hook,  Primordial Cube, and   Beacon: Shocking all increase the value of Runic Lens by allowing it to hit tons of enemies at once.\n\n\n== Math ==\nNote: After update 1.3.6, Overspill is no longer mentioned in the Runic Lens' in-game description. This section may be outdated.\nThe definition of Overspill is\noverspill=\u230atotalDamage/baseDamage\u230b\nThis is used to calculate the chance of proccing the item\nchance=min(5+overspill\u00d7stacks,50)\nWhen the roll is successful, the meteor summoned deals damage equal to\ndamage=min(20+0.5\u00d7overspill\u00d7stacks,75)\nThis value is calculated in terms of base damage multiples, i.e., at most it will do 7500% of base damage.\nThe average damage done by this attack is simply chance\u00d7damage.\nThe following table shows how much damage the meteor will deal on average for various Overspill and item stack values. This assumes no luck. To see instead how much an instance of damage a meteor will deal whenever procced, one has to only take into account the damage formula from above.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: \"Insurance Nightmare\"\nEstimated Delivery: 06/28/2027\nShipping method: High Priority\n\nShipping Address: Merchants Guild, Neon Nexus, Mercury\nShipping details:\n\nAppraisal complete.\nFull report and certificate of Kosthenticity attached.\n\nIf its user starts a fight, this wretched thing will certainly finish it.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nDon\u2019t touch the pale yellow runes, ever, for any reason.\nDon\u2019t sleep near it.\nDon\u2019t make eye contact with it.\nDon\u2019t use it indoors.\n\nI\u2019ve included the bill for my roof.\n\n- Kosta of Crumbling Tower\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nOld Functionality - Overspill. 5% chance (+1% per 100% done on initial hit plus 1% per item stack) on hit to summon a meteor on the target, dealing 2000% damage (+50% damage per 100% damage done on initial hit plus +50% damage per item stack).\nNew Functionality - 3% chance on hit to call a meteor strike, dealing 2000% base damage. Every 100% attack damage dealt increases the activation chance by 3% (+3% per stack) and damage by 150% (+50% per stack.)\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nRunic Lens",
