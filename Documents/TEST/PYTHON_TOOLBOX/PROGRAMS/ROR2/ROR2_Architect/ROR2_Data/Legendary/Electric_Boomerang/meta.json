    "desc": "15% chance on hit to fire an electric boomerang that travels a short distance before returning, dealing 120% (+120% per stack) damage and stunning all enemies hit. Also deals an additional 42% (+42% per stack) per second. Can strike enemies on the way back.",
    "notes": "Electric Boomerang is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nWhen the holder hits an enemy, there is a 15% chance (which is multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient) to fire an electric boomerang that travels a set distance before returning to the player, dealing 120% (+120% per stack) damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and stunning enemies hit. The initial shot and the return trip count as separate attacks, allowing each boomerang to hit twice. Additionally, after the initial strike, each boomerang deals 42% (+42% per stack) damage rapidly with a proc coefficient of 0.2.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nBoomerangs can get stuck in terrain, resulting in a large amount of hits on any enemy standing near one.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe camp is not well. Blood, thorns and worse litter the area. Days old. He almost made it. He wanders numbly through the wreckage to salvage what he can, eyes empty.\nInside the science vessel Private Gupta finds the roster exceeds the graves he dug. Maybe some escaped. Checking crew quarters, Gupta gasps and rushes up to a mounted metallic boomerang like an old friend.\nHesitating, he pulls it from the wall. He recognizes the signature, his mom\u2019s favorite retired ShockRunner player, \u2019Joseph Tharson\u2019, of The Volts. His grip tightens as he eases shakily to a knee. Maybe he was meant to survive after all.\n-Signal echoes, UES Contact Light\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.7\nHolding Sawmarang equipment will no longer apply bleed when using Electric Boomerang (for real this time!!)\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nElectric Boomerang - No longer applies bleed when carrying Sawmarang equipment.\nCorrection: This was not true. It still applied bleed while carrying a Sawmerang.\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nElectric Boomerang",
