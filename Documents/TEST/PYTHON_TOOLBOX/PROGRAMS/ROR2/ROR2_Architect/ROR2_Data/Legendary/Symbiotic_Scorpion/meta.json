    "notes": "The Symbiotic Scorpion is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nOn hit, it has a 100% chance (multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient) to inflict   Permanent Armor Reduction on the target, permanently decreasing the victim's armor by 2 (+2 per stack).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nAlthough the wording of \"permanent\" makes the item's effect sound rather unforgiving, any stacks of   Permanent Armor Reduction that a player or ally might have accumulated over the course of a stage will be removed when they move on to the next stage, or are revived, similar to the   Permanent Curse debuff from Eclipse 8.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nKeep in mind that negative armor has an asymptotic cap of +100% damage taken, meaning that inflicting more stacks of   Permanent Armor Reduction generally has diminishing returns.\nHowever, an exception to this is monsters which can gain a large amount of extra armor under certain circumstances, such as   Clay Dunestriders,   Scavengers, and   Mithrix. With enough stacks of this item's debuff, these monsters' additional armor can be negated, allowing them to take significantly more damage than normal in these circumstances.\nAlthough the effects of Symbiotic Scorpion and  Shattering Justice are similar, which one is more effective for a given player will depend on their survivor and build. Those focused on stacking up proc effects in order to steadily whittle enemies down would be better off with the Scorpion, whereas those with a focus on heavy hits and burst damage might prefer  Shattering Justice.\nThis item can be incredibly dangerous if discovered by a   Scavenger, stolen by   Mithrix, or given to the monsters on the final stage of the   Void Fields, as practically every hit the Survivors take from the holder(s) will increase the damage they'll take from all attacks for the full remainder of the stage.\nSimilar precautions should be taken when playing with Artifact of Chaos, Artifact of Vengeance, and/or Artifact of Evolution. Chaos and Vengeance can make it dangerous for the players to pick up Symbiotic Scorpion, and Evolution could give one or more to all enemies the player(s) might encounter.\nDespite being a debuff, Symbiotic Scorpion's armor reduction is not removed by the effects of  Blast Shower.\n Ben's Raincoat prevents the accumulation of   Permanent Armor Reduction stacks, but will not remove stacks that were in place prior to its collection.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"There's countless ways to defeat your enemy. You can shoot them. You can punch them. Beat them, mash them, stick them in a stew, list goes on. But man, one thing that really makes me laugh...? That's right:\n\nBurying them under a mound of scorpions.\"\n\n\"You're messed up in the head, Bill.\"\n\n- Signal echoes, UES Contact Light\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Symbiotic Scorpion\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe logbook entry for the Symbiotic Scorpion briefly references a popular line from the Lord of the Rings films in which Samwise Gamgee talks about ways to cook potatoes: \"Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew.\"",
