    "notes": "The Interstellar Desk Plant is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2.\n5 seconds after the holder kills an enemy, a small potted plant appears on the ground where that enemy died. After another 0.5 seconds, the plant creates a healing zone with a 10 meter radius (+5m per stack) that heals all allies within for 5% of their maximum health per 0.5 second, similarly to  Bustling Fungus. It takes 0.5 seconds for the healing radius to reach its maximum size.\nEach plant lasts for 10 seconds before disappearing.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of the base healing radius being 5m is incorrect. It is actually 10m.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe  Forgive Me Please pairs very well with this item, as it will spawn multiple plants on top of each other and create a powerful healing radius.\n  Engineer can make some great use with this item, especially if running the ability  TR58 Carbonizer Turret. Since the turrets move with Engineer, the nearby enemies that they kill will activate this item, and the turrets can possibly walk into the healing area.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: \"Interstellar Plant Seed\"\n\nTracking Number: 44******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 08/27/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Standard/Biological\n\nShipping Address: Giardina Dealership, Naples, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nHello - yes, I\u2019d like one of those space plant seeds for the office. I think it would look so nice in here; it'd really brighten up the room, and it could really use it. Al at the Denver branch says he got one, and it's really made a difference. His sales are OFF the charts, and he's attributing all his success to this magic plant!\n\nI've also heard that it sorta gives off a glow that has medical benefits. That would be great for the pain I've been having in my ankle after that run. Might even help the attitude of some of my customers.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nBug Fixes\nFixed Deskplant healing wards sometimes appearing underground\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nHealing Radius: 3m (+1.5m per stack) \u21d2 5m (+5m per stack)\nHealing: 5% max health every 1 second \u21d2 5% max health every 0.5 second\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item: Interstellar Desk Plant\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Interstellar Desk Plant\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nAn Interstellar Desk Plant can be seen on the desk of the multiplayer lobby screen.\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
