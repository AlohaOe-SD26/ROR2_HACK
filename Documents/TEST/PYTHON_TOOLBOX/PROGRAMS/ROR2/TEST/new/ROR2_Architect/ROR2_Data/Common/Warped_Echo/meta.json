    "notes": "The Warped Echo is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion. \nThe next source of damage dealt to the holder will be reduced by 10% and split into 3 \"echoed\" hits (+1 per stack) dealt in 0.75 second intervals. All echoed hits are non-lethal except for the last one.\nAfter splitting damage once, the item goes on cooldown for 15 seconds.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe damage reduction happens after OSP, so you'd end up taking 81% damage instead of 90%.\nDue to how One Shot Protection works, Warped Echo can prevent death at above 90% health regardless of how much curse you have.\nCurse does not remove OSP, it simply limits damage taken to 100% of your combined health.\nAs such, at full health, lethal damage is limited, then reduced by 10%, then split into 3 parts, resulting in 90% damage taken.\nEven at lower than 90% health, your health regeneration inbetween the echoes may heal you enough to still survive.\nDamage increases (such as     ) will increase the damage twice, once when going in and then when echoed.\nThis allows Warped Echo to still bypass One Shot Protection, as while the initial damage is limited to 90% after the increase, the individual Echoed hits may total over 100% health.\nLook out for this interaction when using   Captain's   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike on yourself.\nWhile the Warped Echo is charged, it displays a unique status effect above the health bar and surrounds the holder in a yellow-green bubble.\nAfter taking damage, a new status effect is added and revolving orbs appear around the holder to represent how many echoed hits are remaining.\nSplit damage that has not been dealt yet is displayed in dark red on players' health bar.\nUnlike other items with cooldowns, such as  Safer Spaces and  Breaching Fin, there is not any status effect to indicate that the Warped Echo is on cooldown.\nThe status effects on the damage will not be applied a second time.\nIf the damage is blocked or cancelled (such as by  Tougher Times), Warped Echo will not activate.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item can trigger these items multiple times:\n Roll of Pennies\n Tougher Times\n Razorwire\nThe splitting of damage can give you time to heal and potentially save your life,  Delicate Watches, and/or  Power Elixirs.\nThe delay allows you to use invinciblity to try and dodge following echoed hits, allowing you to further reduce damage taken. This also allows you to avoid death by becoming invincible during the lethal hit.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Glass-Like Europan Compound\nEstimated Delivery: 09/23/2057\nShipping method: Standard\n\nShipping Address:\nPaleontology Department\nUES Satelite 3C\nSaturn\n\nShipping details:\n\nLab Dissection Analysis File\nSubject: Warped Echo\nTechnician: Eleanor Veirs\nTable Spec: Mineral Analysis with Kinetic Soak Gauntlets\n- A smooth circle, cold to the touch. I probably shouldn\u2019t have touched it.\n- Using kinetic gloves, I\u2019ll chisel a piece of the large dark polished \u2019crystal\u2019 for testing.\n- No use. heavy equipment can\u2019t get the crystal to fracture\n- I resentfully observe it intact under a powerful microscope.\n- Despite it\u2019s structured form, compound seems organically created and new to our databases.\n- Carbon indicates this pre-dates the Europan ocean. Barely.\n- My assistant Claire claps me on the back before heading to lunch, I barely feel it.\n- Later I felt an impact on my back in the same spot she touched me.\n- Finally, a breakthrough. We grin like wolves.\nClaire brings her lunch into the lab (not recommended, but delicious).\nI was about to send this boring thing off to Kosta for appraisal, but now we have work to do.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.4.1\nUnmentioned\nReduced damage reduction to 10% (from 20%)\nRemoved Planula and Repulsion Armor Plate synergy.\nFixed bugs like all of them:\nOSP no longer runs after Warped Echo, meaning each damage tick is independently measured against the 90% threshold. (You will no longer die due to warped echo essentially ignoring OSP)\nWarped Echo no longer disregards armor entirely.\nHits that activate Warped Echo now apply Eclipse 8 curse again.\nHits that activate Warped Echo now correctly put you into danger.\nUpdate Notes V1.3.7\nWarped Echo first-hit damage reduction lowered to 20% (was 30%.) Delayed damage ticks can now benefit from items such as Planula and Razorwire (and others!)\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nWarped Echo\nOld Functionality - On damage taken 50% of the damage is dealt immediately while the other 50% is delayed for 3 seconds. This effect has a cooldown of 10 seconds.\nNew Functionality - The next source of damage is reduced by 30% and spread into 3 (+1 per stack) hits. All echoed damage is non-lethal except for the final hit. Recharges every 15s (-3% per stack.)\nSeekers of the Storm - First Patch\nAddressed an issue where Mithrix would become invincible upon stealing a Warped Echo.\nAddressed an issue where Heretic would gain infinite stacks of the Warped Echo buff if she picked up more than one.\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nWarped Echo\n\n\n== Trivia ==",
