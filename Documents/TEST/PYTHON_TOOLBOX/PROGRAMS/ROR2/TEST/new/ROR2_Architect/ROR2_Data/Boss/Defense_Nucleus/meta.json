    "desc": "Killing elite monsters spawns an Alpha Construct with bonus 300% damage and 300% health . Limited to 4 (+4 per stack) .",
    "notes": "The Defense Nucleus is a boss item in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the   Xi Construct, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nWhenever the holder defeats an Elite monster, one friendly   Alpha Construct is spawned at that location, with greatly increased stats. Up to 4 (+4 per stack) can be spawned.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Alpha Constructs will disappear if you are further than a 100 meters away for 30s. This is quite beneficial when staying in one area for a long time such as a Holdout zone event.\nDue to the global ally limit, high stacks of this item may prevent other allies from spawning, e.g.,  Empathy Cores and  Void Allies.\nThe  Artifact of Honor makes this item very useful, as the player can accumulate an army of Alpha Constructs over the course of a stage.\nThe  Forgive Me Please will never trigger the item's effect, even if the Artifact of Honor is enabled.\nAlpha Constructs spawned by the Defense Nucleus can become   Voidtouched by a   Void Infestor, and will no longer help the Survivors. These are particularly dangerous since these allied Alpha Constructs are much stronger than a normal one.\nUnlike most other ally-summoning items, the Defense Nucleus is given to   Engineer's turrets. Each turret tracks its own allied Alpha Construct limit separately, so a turret can spawn up to 4 extra Alpha Constructs per stack of Defense Nucleus. Turrets must be the ones to land the killing blow on Elites to spawn their own Alpha Constructs, however. If the turrets and Engineer can kill enough elites, they can have a total of 12 Alpha Construct allies with just a single Defense Nucleus.\nThe  Lysate Cell gives Engineer an extra turret, increasing the max potential to 16 Alpha Constructs.\nIf a turret is a replaced, its deployable count reference will be lost while its spawned Alpha Constructs will not be affected. The new turret will then be able to spawn more Alpha Constructs.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Excellent!  How did you find it?\"\n\n\"We took down one of those floating fortune tellers--\"\n\n\"Xi Construct.\"\n\n\"Sure.  Anyway, we took it down and recovered the sample.\"\n\n\"May I see it?\"\n\n\"This is it.\"\n\n\"This?  What happened?  I thought you said it was glowing.\"\n\n\"That's right.  It was.  Before I scrapped it.\"\n\n\"...You ...what?\"\n\n\"I scrapped it.\"\n\n\"You were finally able to recover a sample from the Xi Construct, and you scrapped it?  Do you realize monumental importance of the samples we've been gathering?\"\n\n\"I realize the monumental danger.  I've read the lab files.  Daimera's crippled in one hand.  Veirs was THIS close to electrocuting herself.  After Fitz nearly KILLED his ENTIRE team for a VASE, you think I'm going to haul a mysterious glowing orb back here?  HELL.  NO.\"\n\n\"...Well, what's done is done.  I guess I'll analyze what's left.  Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was thinking we could call it a 'Defense Nucleus'.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"In the file.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Defense Nucleus\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item's logbook entry references a pattern in most boss item logbook entries where multiple technicians injure themselves (or come close) while attempting to study the items, such as hand injury ( Shatterspleen), electrocution ( Genesis Loop), and siphoning ( Mired Urn).",
