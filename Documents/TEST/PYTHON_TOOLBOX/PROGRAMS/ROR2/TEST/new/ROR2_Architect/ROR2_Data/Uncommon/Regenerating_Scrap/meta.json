    "notes": "Regenerating Scrap is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void update.\nWhen interacting with an Uncommon 3D Printer or Legendary Cauldron, if the player has any stacks of this item, it will be consumed before any other items, including  Item Scrap, Green. Unlike all other items, when this item is consumed by either a 3D Printer or Cauldron, the player will receive a  Regenerating Scrap (Consumed). At the start of each stage, all Regenerating Scrap (Consumed) will transform back into Regenerating Scrap.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nUsing this item in the Scrapper turns this item into  Item Scrap, Green, which does not regenerate at the start of each stage.\nUncommon 3D Printers will never offer Regenerative Scrap.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nEven though Regenerating Scrap cannot appear in 3D Printers, there is still a printer-related exploit with Regenerating Scrap in Simulacrum. If the Artifact of Command is not active for the run, but the Augment of Command becomes active for a wave, using an Uncommon 3D Printer will generate a Command Essence instead of the displayed item. The player can choose a Regenerating Scrap from the Command Essence and then immediately use it to print a new Command Essence. This can be repeated until the wave ends, or for as long as the player can survive in the void.\nThis item encourages active use of Uncommon printers. Even if the printed item is undesired, it can be later scrapped into  Item Scrap, Green for more available printing in later stages.\n5 or more stacks of this item can be used to repeatedly gain legendary items in the   Bazaar. This functions the same as 3D Printers, consuming the item, rather than trading it.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"Hey, Joe, how's the work in engineering?\"\n\n\"Terrible. We have a shipment of this... weird, prototype material. Some kind of metal? They want us to make stuff out of it, which isn't too bad. Thing is, no matter how much I take, there always seems to be more. Did you know I made twenty-five hundred units of .300 caliber rounds from a 10 kilo crate of metal?\"\n\n\"How much!?\"\n\n\"Right!? I feel like I'm losing my mind. It's not even half-way empty. Hell, I bet there's more in there than when I started!\"\n\n\"Well, at least you won't have to worry about running out...\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Regenerating Scrap\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThere appears to be a hand reaching out from the glowing part of Regenerating Scrap.\nBetween the release of the Alloyed Collective and Update V1.4.1, there was one printer in the   Computational Exchange that could spawn with the Artifact of Command active and could have an uncommon item, thus allowing infinite items to be created, simmilar to the Simulacrum exploit above.",
