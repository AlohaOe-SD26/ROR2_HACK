    "notes": "N'kuhana's Retort is an Elite equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {  Malachite Elite. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Malachite Elite, but this chance is affected by  57 Leaf Clover and  Purity.\nA player equipped with N'kuhana's Retort gains the power of a Malachite Elite; their attacks inflict the {  healing disabled debuff for 8 seconds, and they will periodically release spiked balls. The amount varies depending on the characters size, ranging from 3 at minimum, 4 on Acrid and False Son, up to 19 on Grandparents. On impact, the balls create a small explosion for 100% damage and sprout spike pits that deal 100% contact damage. Additionally, when the equipped player dies, a   Malachite Urchin will spawn and shoot at nearby monsters, but even with  Dio's Best Friend this effect is of limited usefulness.\nAlthough N'kuhana's Retort is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from  Fuel Cells do not affect its behavior.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Engineer can make considerably better use of this equipment than most Survivors, since his turrets can create their own spike balls and are expendable enough to trigger the on-death urchin.\n  Scavengers can potentially be highly vulnerable to having their healing disabled, as they can spawn with (or pick up) healing items. This equipment is especially useful for   Kipkip the Gentle, who wields many healing items.\nGiving this equipment to an   Equipment Drone is a decent idea, as it will not only disable enemies' healing to help with synergies such as  Death Mark, but it can also deal damage by spawning spike pits.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nSome creatures holding the item have their head move and twitch in abrupt motions. Most monsters and survivors without a defined head such as,   Engineer and   REX will not have this effect.\n\n\n== Gallery ==",
