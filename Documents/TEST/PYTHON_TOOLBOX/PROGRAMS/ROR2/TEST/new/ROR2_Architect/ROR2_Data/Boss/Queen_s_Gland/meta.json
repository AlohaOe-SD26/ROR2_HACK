    "notes": "The Queen's Gland is a boss item in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the   Beetle Queen.\nThe holder gains a   Beetle Guard ally that fights for them. This Beetle Guard is much more powerful than normal; it deals 4 times as much damage and has twice as much health as a regular Beetle Guard. The number of Beetle Guards a player can have at once is equal to the number of Queen's Glands they have.\nA new Beetle Guard is summoned as soon as the game finds a suitable location and if the player does not have the maximum number of Guards yet. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe respawn timer of 30 seconds is bugged and does not work properly. It starts with a timer of 0, so upon item pick up the Beetle Guard will attempt to spawn immediately. There is also a second internal cooldown timer of 1 second, which is used to retry a spawn when it has failed, e.g. because of chosen location. However, this internal cooldown is used even when a spawn has succeeded.\nIf the player damages the allied Beetle Guard with an item such as the  Helfire Tincture, it will give chase and attempt to attack the player. However, it will not do any damage.\nIf the Artifact of Swarms is active, one Queen's Gland will result in two Beetle Guards spawning with half health.\nThe Queen's Gland is one of the few blacklisted items that   Engineer's turrets will not inherit.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Yeah, uh, Kaitlin?

Confused, maybe. Anyways, I was walking up to them to get rid of em, and strangely enough they seemed passive. The same bugs that gave me that concussion yesterday, and-\"\n\n\"What?! Are you okay? \"\n\n\"Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. Anyways, I felt bad killin' them since they seemed all... inert and such. So I just kinda left and they've been following me ever since. Real weird. Anyways, I guess I've made some friends. I wonder what they eat... do they eat? Since they don't have any mouths that I-\"\n\n\"Rich, stop! Please don't bring them back to camp! \"\n\n\"Oh, well uh...I could - Junior, stop! Leave your brother alone! \"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nBug Fixes\nUpdated outdated icons for friendly   Beetle Guards\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\nLimit of deployed Beetle Guards now doubles for Artifact of Swarms\nQuality of Life\n\ud83c\udf27 Updated the   Beetle Guard visuals when they spawn from a Beetle Gland to stand out more\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nSpawns all possible guards at once when stacked, rather than one at a time",
