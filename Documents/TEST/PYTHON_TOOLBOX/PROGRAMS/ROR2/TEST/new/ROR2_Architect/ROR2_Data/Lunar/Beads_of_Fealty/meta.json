    "notes": "The Beads of Fealty are a lunar item introduced in the Hidden Realms Update. It is unlocked after completing the True Respite challenge by obliterating yourself at the Obelisk at   A Moment, Fractured.\nUpon pickup, they offer no benefits or detriments to the player beyond giving them an extra item. However, when the player enters the Celestial Portal to enter A Moment, Fractured and obliterates themself at the Obelisk, they will be transported to A Moment, Whole before ending the run. This secret area contains one of the four   Twisted Scavengers, each of which have their own preset list of items and equipment unlike regular   Scavengers.\nStacking the Beads beyond the first pickup has no additional effect.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nSince most Lunar items have an effect that is severely detrimental to the player, the Beads of Fealty provide players with an item to convert with a Cleansing Pool without risk.\nDying to the   Twisted Scavenger after obliterating will not grant mastery skins.\nBeads of Fealty cannot be obtained in either the Eclipse or Simulacrum game modes, as A Moment, Fractured is inaccessible in both.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe master of this world is a benevolent protector. Our savior. Despite the natures of its various inhabitants, he has made a peaceful place here. \n\nPeace comes at a cost, of course. Some things are strictly forbidden. Above all, there is one item that cannot be tolerated \u2013 to possess it is to surely perish: a strange, heavy, and deeply entrancing set of beads that seem to speak with whoever holds them. \n\nTo discover them among one\u2019s community is to create a dark, rippling panic. It is not long after they are found that Providence, the mighty protector, appears in a thunderous instant to pursue their owner and solemnly take a life he swore to defend.\n\nIt is no physical property of the beads themselves which provoke such a drastic response - but instead, what they represent. They are a symbol, and to carry them is a dark promise to undo the world \u2013 to cast to oblivion all people who find their final place here, all in exchange for a doomed return to ruinous way. The elusive, sinister intelligence with whom these beads represent a pact seems known only to the bearer - and to Providence himself.\n\nOne thing, however, is known to anyone who has borne witness to these beads: a cruel, cackling laughter that erupts as blood and coins of favor are spilled, abruptly silenced as the beads are destroyed. Where they come from isn\u2019t known, but should you encounter these beads you must leave them far, far behind. \n\nNever look back.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Beads of Fealty\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lunar Item: Beads of Fealty",
