    "notes": "The Super Massive Leech is an equipment added in Content Update 5.\nWhen activated, the holder gets the   Life Steal buff for 8 seconds, healing them for 20% of all direct damage dealt.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis equipment pairs extremely well with   REX, allowing them to recoup HP used to cast their skills.\nPair the Leech with  N'kuhana's Opinion to turn the Leech's healing into even more damage.\nBonus multipliers to damage, such as those from critical strikes or the  Focus Crystal, are not considered when calculating healing. For instance, a hit that deals 100 damage, boosted to 120 by the Focus Crystal, will only heal 20 HP (not 24).\nThe Leech also does not grant healing from damage-over-time sources such as   Bleed from the  Tri-Tip Dagger.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nReturn: Super Massive Leech\n\nTracking Number: 817*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 07/01/2056\n\nShipping Method: High Priority/Biological\n\nShipping Address: Rare/Extinct Study Satellite, Beachfront, Saturn\n\nShipping Details:\n\nWhile the medical benefits of this creature are obvious, the psychological effects are not. Upon receiving a previous shipment, Carolyn took charge of research and experimentation with the organism. \n\nEverything was by the book until, one day, she walked into the lab with the specimen clearly attached to her neck. Incredibly startled, the rest of us eventually coaxed her into placing it back into containment.\n\nWe inspected the bite area but, after running all the standard tests, we did not observe any adverse side effects.\n\nShe stated that it made her feel fantastic, but no one else in the lab felt comfortable with her behavior.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Equipment: Super Massive Leech\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Super Massive Leech\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nAlthough it is technically a new item, this item can be considered an upgraded version of the Massive Leech from Risk of Rain 1.",
