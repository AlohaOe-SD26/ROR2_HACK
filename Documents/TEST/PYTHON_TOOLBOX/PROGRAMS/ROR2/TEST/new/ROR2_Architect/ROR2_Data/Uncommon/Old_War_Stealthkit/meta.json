    "notes": "The Old War Stealthkit is an item in Risk of Rain 2.\nWhen the holder falls below 25% of their max HP, they become   invisible and   gain 40% movement speed for 5 seconds. This stealth mode has a cooldown of 30 seconds (-50% per stack).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item is useful when using the  Transcendence or  Shared Design, as the holder must avoid damage for 7 seconds to recover their shields. The Stealthkit's invisibility and bonus movement speed greatly aid in a retreat after sustaining heavy damage.\nNote that damage over time, such as   Bleed or   Burn, will prevent shields from regenerating until the effect has expired. Be aware of this when retreating.\nThe  Genesis Loop pairs extremely well with the Stealthkit, as both items activate simultaneously and stack similarly. Use the Genesis Loop's explosion to clear out nearby enemies and use the Stealthkit to find a more advantageous position.\n  Bandit's   Smoke Bomb invisibility and movement speed buffs are timed separately from the Stealthkit's buffs. If the Stealthkit is active, using Smoke Bomb will not increase the duration of invisibility or bonus movement speed.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder:  Misc. OW Artifacts (47)\n\nTracking Number: 01******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 08/13/2056\n\nShipping Method: Priority\n\nShipping Address: National Old War Museum, New Orleans, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nWe've managed to round up all the local Old War artifacts that we could find. A lot of interesting things here: rifles, rations, pamphlets. We even found a prototype stealthkit in fantastic condition; that could be a great centerpiece for your exhibit.\n\nHowever, a slight issue: in transit, the truck hit a pothole and jostled all the ship. It seemed to have actually activated the stealth drive - some strange short-circuit - and our team can't actually confirm the location of the stealthkit. It should be in one of the boxes - we will be expecting the commission to include the stealthkit.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\nNow activates when falling to low health, rather than as a chance when hurt\nStealth Duration: 3s (+1.5s per stack) \u21d2 5s\nStealth Cooldown: 0s \u21d2 30s (-50% per stack)\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nBefore the Anniversary Update, the chance to activate was based on the percentage of max health and max shield the damage dealt, 1% damage = 1% chance to activate. This chance was calculated after all damage reductions from Armor and other sources had taken effect. The chance was affected by the  57 Leaf Clover.",
