    "notes": "Paul's Goat Hoof is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2.  It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the \"Is This Bugged?\" Challenge.\nThe item increases the player's base movement speed by 14% (+14% per stack).   \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis speed bonus is calculated before any other speed bonus in the game; speed gained from  Warbanner,  Berzerker's Pauldron, and other speed-boosting items is added on top of the speed from the amount of goat hooves in the player's inventory.\nThe  Spinel Tonic, however, multiplies final movement speed, thereby enhancing all speed-boosting items.\nWhen compared to the  Energy Drink while sprinting, the hoof provides a 20.3% increase in speed, while the energy drink's is of 25%. Keep in mind that while the hoof is active at all times, the drink is only of use if the character is sprinting, this also means energy drinks are of no use to the   final boss on the last phase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Paul\u2019s Goat Hoof\n\nTracking Number: 187*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 03/27/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Standard\n\nShipping Address: 2663rd Fields, Redmond, Venus\n\nShipping Details:\n\nA hoof from one of my many goats; I noticed one day that one of my goats had an abnormally large foot. Thinking it was cancerous, I went to the doctors and lo-and-behold - it was. My goat died shortly after.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Paul's Goat Hoof\nQuality of Life\nUpdate visuals to match other assets\nBug Fixes\nFixed certain survivors not removing their limbs when picking up Paul\u2019s Goat Hoof\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item is named after Paul Morse, one of the two founders of Hopoo Games.\nHaving at least one of this item will change the sound of every other step to a clopping sound on every character except   Artificer,   REX, and a sprinting   Engineer or   Void Fiend.\nThe Steam achievement recieved for unlocking Paul's Goat Hoof, \"Is This Bugged?\" still displays the appearance the item had before the Anniversary Update.",
