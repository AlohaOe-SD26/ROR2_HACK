    "notes": "The Collector's Compulsion is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Alloyed Collective expansion.\nIt grants the user a +3% increase to all stats for 20 seconds whenever the user picks up an item, up to 3 (+2 per stack) times.\nAll the stat increases are multiplicative, after all other item stats have been added, which may be worse for some stats and better for others.\nThe 'all stats' of this item does not include acceleration.\n\n\n== Valid Pickups ==\nThe following are valid ways to gain the Collector's Compulsion buff:\n\nOpening barrels\nPicking up items, temporary items, equipment, Lunar Coins, etc.\nPicking up  Elusive Antlers' energy orbs\nPicking up  Bandolier's ammo packs\nPicking up   Drifter's Junk\nPicking up health orbs from:\n Monster Tooth\n Seed of Life (Consumed)\n  REX's harvest fruits\n  CHEF's Kiss kebab\n  Cleanup Drone\nPicking up gold nuggets from:\n Ghor's Tome\n  Gilded Elites\n  Cleanup Drone\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Drifter benefits greatly from this item, as she regularly drops Junk with her   Blunt Force, allowing her to consistently get the buff stacks.\nThe buff stacks are also granted by temporary items, making it pair well with   Salvage.\n  CHEF also benefits greatly from this item due to its   CHEF's Kiss passive, which drops health pickups upon killing an enemy that was hit by two or more of its skills.\n  False Son gets Growth from the buff granted by this item.\nItems like  Monster Tooth,  Bandolier and  Ghor's Tome combo well, as the pickups they spawn grant stacks of the buff. This also makes it work well with the   Cleanup Drone, which drops similar pickups.\n Elusive Antlers are an especially good pairing with this item, as picking up one of its energy orbs grants the user two buffs at once: The speed buff from the Antlers, and the stats increase from Collector's Compulsion.\nCollector's Compulsion benefits from  Growth Nectar, as having a buff from Collector's Compulsion also grants one stack of a buff from Growth Nectar.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nClarification: This item increases max health, movement speed, damage, attack speed, crit, regen, and armor.\nUnlike other movement speed increases, acceleration is not increased here, potentially leading to feeling \"slippery\".\nMultiplicative crit chance is far less beneficial than linear.\nMultiplicative armor is not beneficial if you do not any armor granting items or are playing a survivor with base armor.\nUnlike  Irradiant Pearl, it does affect all armor, not just base armor.\n Remote Caffeinator's cans of soda do not grant the buff.\n Infusion's max health orbs not grant the buff.\nHaving a  Substandard Duplicator and picking up an item does not grant two buffs.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"In the year 2034, the renowned Black Friday sale was permanently banned in all world markets after a gruesome stampede erupted at the New Times Square Shopping Mall. Approximately 35 were killed in the stampede, and dozens more were critically injured. A notable participant in the stampede was 43-year-old Susan Monroe, a single mother who was responsible for taking the lives of 5 innocent shoppers. In an interview, Susan claimed: \"I mean, can you blame me? My boy wanted the new gaming console, and it was on sale for 5 dollars. 5 dollars! I'd do it again for that price.\"\"\n\n - History of Earth, Volume VII\n\n\n== Version History ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nSeveral items can be seen inside:\n Royal Capacitor\n Mocha",
