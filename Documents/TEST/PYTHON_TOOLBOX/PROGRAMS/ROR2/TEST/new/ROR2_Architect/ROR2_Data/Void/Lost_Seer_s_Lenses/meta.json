    "notes": "The Lost Seer's Lenses are a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of the  Lens-Maker's Glasses.\nUpon hitting a non-boss enemy, there is a 0.5% (+0.5% per stack) chance to instantly kill it, multiplied by the attack's proc coefficient. This chance is affected by luck.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nObtaining 200 Lost Seer's Lenses causes every hit to a non-boss to result in an instant kill.\nA non-boss enemy counts as anything without a red health bar. A \"boss\" should not be confused with Boss Monsters or monsters holding  Infusion, which has the same red health bar, but are not designated as bosses.\nRed health bars can appear for Teleporter Event bosses and Simulacrum boss waves; Lost Seer's Lenses will be ineffective against these enemies.\nSince the Lost Seer's Lenses are ineffective against boss enemies and the  Armor-Piercing Rounds only work on boss enemies, Armor-Piercing Rounds can help make up the lost damage against bosses.\nWhen the player hits an enemy and the instant-kill roll succeeds, it adds a Void Death damage type to the attack, similar to the   Void Reaver's implosion, which causes instant death with a unique visual of inflicting massive damage. Because the  Brilliant Behemoth inherits the damage type of the triggering hit, if the attack that activates the Behemoth succeeds the instant-kill roll, then the Behemoth's explosion will also instantly kill anything it hits.\nThis also allows the player to instantly kill bosses because they are also vulnerable to the instant-kill damage type. For example, by instantly killing an enemy that is sufficiently close to a boss, the Behemoth's explosion can transfer this instant-kill roll. However,   Mithrix and   Voidling are immune to Void Death effects, so this scenario does not work on them.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nHaving  57 Leaf Clovers can greatly improve the rate of instant killing.\nInstantly killing a   Gup will prevent it from splitting into   Geep. Other enemy on-death effects are unaffected however.\nWhen carrying a large quantity of Lens-Maker's Glasses alongside critical-related items (e.g.  Harvester's Scythe), picking up the Lost Seer's Lenses may end up being detrimental.\nThe player can make up for lost critical chance by using the  Ocular HUD, though only while the buff is active.\n  Bandit's   Backstab and   Railgunner's   Magnetic Accelerator can still consistently allow for the effects of critical-related items without needing  Lens-Maker's Glasses, making this item more viable for them.\nFor Bandit, instant kills triggered by   Desperado will grant a   Desperado Stack and instant kills triggered by   Lights Out will reset cooldowns\nWith the exception of Railgunner, having more than 10 Lens-Maker's Glasses (100% crit chance) is often pointless, so corrupting them can be useful if the player has passed that threshold, allowing the player to get the most out of 11+ Lens-Maker's Glasses.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"What does it mean to see?\n\nTo a beast, it means to identify potential food and mates. To propagate, to survive. Sight is nothing more than a means to an end, is it not?\n\nTo someone like me... To those who know true purpose... To see is to LIVE. To see is to spot that one little crack in the enemy's armor, to spot that smallest moment of hesitation when they rear back to strike.\n\nTo see the way flesh folds once the skull gives in to your weapon.\n\nYes, it's the little things, but seeing those things... REALLY seeing them. Ah, it fulfills you. I do hope you understand... And if not, you will eventually, if you've read this note.\"\n\n- Lost Journal, recovered from Petrichor V\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Lost Seer's Lenses\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe effect animation and sound are similar to those of             Void implosions, that also display instant-kill.",
