    "notes": "The Tri-Tip Dagger is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nOn hit, it gives a 10% (+10% per stack) chance to inflict   Bleed on the target (which is multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient), dealing a total of 240% damage across (3 x proc coefficient) seconds (20% per tick, 4 ticks per second).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nUnlike most other damage-over-time debuffs, an existing stack of Bleed will have its duration extended when a new stack with a longer duration is inflicted (e.g. if a stack has 1 second remaining but a new 3-second stack is inflicted, the 1-second stack is refreshed to 3 seconds). This means Bleed can be stacked infinitely as long as it is continuously inflicted.\nHowever, hits with a low proc coefficient will inflict shorter-duration stacks of Bleed, meaning that even with 100% Bleed chance, the window to inflict the next Bleed stack to refresh existing ones is much narrower.\nThe Tri-Tip Dagger's chance to activate stacks linearly 10%. With 10 daggers, attacks with 1.0 proc chance will have a 100% chance to bleed.\nThis item's Bleed effect is the same debuff as the Bleed inflicted by the  Shatterspleen; if both items are held, only one stack of Bleed can be inflicted per hit.\nThis item and  Noxious Thorn both contribute towards the same chance to apply bleed on-hit, and do not roll independently of each other.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nWelcome to DataScraper (v3.1.53 \u2013 beta branch)\n\n$ Scraping memory... done.\n\n$ Resolving... done.\n\n$ Combing for relevant data... done.\n\nComplete!\n\nThe following is an audio transcript from the trial of D.

In an attempt to spill yet more innocent blood from them?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes. Was my favorite part.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour favorite part, you say. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I think you all can see that Mr. Cooper is a truly deranged man - who took the lives of countless innocent people. However, if you are not fully convinced, I have one more piece of evidence to provide for the jury\u2019s consideration. Your honor, if I may prepare an audio recording of Mr. Cooper?\u201d\n\n\u201cProceed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, your honor. Now, please play back the recording.\u201d\n\nThe remainder of this court transcript has been sealed.\n\nReason: i think im gonna be sick\n\n\n== Placement ==\n\n\n=== Survivors ===\n  Commando places it embedded into the top of his left shoulder.\n  Huntress places it embedded into the top of her left shoulder.\n  Bandit places it at the end of his long gun's barrel, similar to a bayonet.\n  MUL-T places it embedded into the top of its right shoulder.\n  Engineer places it embedded into the top of his left grenade cannon, to its back.\n  Artificer places it embedded into the top of her left shoulder, to its back.\n  Mercenary places it embedded into the top of his left shoulder.\n  REX places it on its left back leg, before the joint, facing its backside.\n  Loader places it embedded into her left upper arm.\n  Acrid places it embedded above its left shoulder, near its back quills.\n  Captain places it embedded into the top of his left shoulder, to its back.\n  Railgunner places it near the end of her railgun.\n  Void Fiend places it on its right thigh.\n  Seeker places it embedded near the bottom of her back tank.\n  False Son places it embedded into the top of his left shoulder.\n  CHEF places it inside its bag, alongside its cleavers.\n  Operator places it embedded into the side of his right shoulder.\n  Drifter places it embedded into the top of her left shoulder.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Non-Playable Characters ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Unused Characters ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Instances of Bleed from Tri-Tip Dagger no longer stack when combined with Shatterspleen.\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Tri-Tip Dagger\nGameplay Changes\nBleed Chance: 15% (+15% per stack) \u21d2 10% (+10% per stack)  Developer Notes: Right now, bleed is okay until you can stack it infinitely, in which case it becomes incredibly strong. We want to smooth out the power curve a bit, increasing the number of daggers required for \u2018infinite\u2019 bleed to match the number of Glasses required for 100% crit.\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nBug Fixes\nFix cropping issues on Tri-Tip Dagger icon\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Tri-Tip Dagger is the successor to the Rusty Knife from Risk of Rain 1, which has a virtually identical effect.\nThis item is based on a real type of knife known as a tri-edge dagger or simply a tri-dagger, which features three spiraling blade edges that meet at the tip. This type of dagger causes more serious internal damage than a traditional blade and the triangular wound inflicted is more difficult to properly suture. This has resulted in some urban legends falsely claiming that due to the long suffering inflicted on a victim, the dagger's use is ruled a war crime.",
