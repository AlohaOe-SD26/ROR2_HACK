    "notes": "The Newly Hatched Zoea is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void update. It is the corruption of all boss items (excluding  Artifact Keys,  Encrypted Cerebellums,  Exposed Cerebellums,  Prison Matrices, and  Sentry Keys) and is dropped by the   Void Devastator.\nEvery 60 seconds (-50% per stack), the holder gets a friendly void ally, which is either a   Void Reaver,   Void Jailer, or (rarely)   Void Devastator. The holder may only have up to 1 (+1 per stack) void ally summoned this way at a time.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The rate of cooldown is not -50% exponentially per stack, as the actual formula is 60/stacks. So while going from 1 to 2 stacks the cooldown increases by 50%, this does not follow the same pattern for any other stack number.\nSince the   Void Devastator cannot normally spawn as a teleporter boss, the only way to obtain this item from the teleporter event is during a void Family Event, which makes it possible for it to spawn as a teleporter boss.\nAlternatively, one may acquire this item from a resurrection via  Pluripotent Larva, as long as a boss item was taken beforehand.\nObtaining this item by corrupting a boss item with the  Pluripotent Larva will not unlock the Newly Hatched Zoea's logbook entry. To unlock its logbook entry, it has to be picked up as an item dropped by a   Void Devastator.\nAnother option is using a  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn on a Void Devastator that can spawn within a Void Seed. However, this will probably not happen in the first few stages as the difficulty coefficient will not be high enough to afford the spawn (see Camp Director for more information).\nThis item will also corrupt the  Pearl and  Irradiant Pearl, since they have the Boss rarity.\nThis item also corrupts  Halcyon Seeds due to its Boss rarity.\nUmbrae from the Artifact of Vengeance will inherit the item and spawn Void allies, but will never drop the Newly Hatched Zoea, even if it was the Umbra's only item.\nThe void ally types to spawn are added to a pool, with 15 copies of   Void Reaver, 15 copies of   Void Jailer, and 1 copy of   Void Devastator. This gives probabilities of roughly 3.2% for a Devastator, and 48.3% for either a Reaver or Jailer.\nIf the Artifact of Chaos is enabled, any   Void Reaver spawned from the item cannot target allies, even when aggravated. However, allies can still be damaged by their basic attack if it hits them when it's hitting an enemy.\nThe void implosion created by allied void enemies can kill the player and their allies.\nThe   Void Devastator is the only enemy that can drop Newly Hatched Zoea, even with Artifact of Command.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Engineer's turrets do inherit the Newly Hatched Zoea, allowing for 2 additional void allies per item stack.\nOn top of that, respawning the turrets will allow for even more void allies. This is because the reference to the deployable count of the replaced turret disappears, even though the void allies it spawned are not affected.\nIf   Engineer has  Pluripotent Larva and any boss item, turrets will gain Newly Hatched Zoea upon dying and being resurrected even though the Engineer will not. This is the only indirect way of spawning void allies without the player holding the item.\nVoid implosions from void allies are still lethal to the player and their other void allies. Be mindful that one ally's death may lead to avalanching instant-kill explosions.\nNotably, these void implosions cannot kill any of the final bosses;   Mithrix,   Voidling,   Solus Wing   False Son, and   Solus Heart.\nThere is a global ally limit of 20 at a time. This includes void allies, drones,   Squid Turrets, or any other ally that appears on the left side of the screen. This means the ally spawn scaling of Newly Hatched Zoea hard caps at 20 stacks without any other allies. The cooldown however will be 3s, and will continue to decrease with further stacks.\nUnlike the normal void enemies, the allied void monsters spawned by this item take damage from   Void Fog/  Void Fog Strong, making them less effective in places like the   Void Fields and   Void Locus. Several stacks of Zoea can be increasingly dangerous in these areas since it increases the number of void allies and the rate they spawn, coupled with the generally slow movement speed of these allies means that when they die from Void Fog damage they'll cause void implosions nearby the small radius of 'safe' zones that players will be within to charge objectives.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn biology, the term \"zoea\" refers to a larval stage in development experienced by many ten-legged crustaceans, especially crabs.\nThis is in keeping with the crab-like appearance of the boss tied to the item, the   Void Devastator, which seems to imply that the item itself is some form of the boss's offspring.\nFurthermore, the item's ability to summon a   Void Reaver or   Void Jailer, as opposed to just the   Void Devastator which dropped it in the first place, might suggest that all three monsters are directly related to one another in some way.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nLab Dissection Analysis File\n\nSubject: Newly Hatched Zoea\n\nTechnician: X.
