    "notes": "The Sale Star is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion. \nUpon opening a chest, gain an extra item from the loot table of that chest. Each stack grants an additional 5% chance for an extra item to be obtained. All stacks are consumed upon opening the first chest per stage, and it regenerates at the beginning of each stage.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nIn addition to chests, this item works on Equipment Barrels, Rusty Lockboxes, Legendary Chests (including the guaranteed ones on   Abyssal Depths and   Sundered Grove), and Adaptive Chests.\nIt does not work with Shrines of Chance, Multishop Terminals, Lunar Pods, Void Cradles, Void Potentials, Encrusted Caches, or Scavenger backpacks.\nFor Adaptive Chests, you will gain additional copies of the chosen item, rather than additional random items.\n\n\n== Math ==\nSale Star can grant up to 4 additional items, for up to 5 items from a single chest.\nThe chance to obtain additional items after the first extra one depends on how many Sale Stars the player is holding.\n\nAt 2 Sale Stars: after the first extra item, 3 rolls occur:\nA 30% chance to get a third item from a chest\nA further 15% chance to get a fourth item\nA further 1% chance to get a fifth item\nAt 3 Sale Stars and above: the above rolls occur, but each Sale Star adds an extra 5% chance for each roll to succeed.\nThese rolls are affected by luck.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\nTwo UES Cadets cluster behind their scanning machine to stare at a small, simple-looking star.\n\n\"What IS it though? I thought it threw an alert?\"\n\n\"Well it\u2019s not anymore, maybe the scanner is finally goin\u2019.\" One Cadet flips the star around and squints. \"I think there\u2019s a B carved into it\u2026\"\n\n\"Wish it would, they won\u2019t send us a new one until this fossilizes.\" The other Cadet slaps the scanner.\n\nA visiting General turns the corner and cuts in, \"Problem, Cadets?\"\n\nBoth Cadets squeal and snap to attention, saluting the General. The suspicious star clatters down the approval chute with a loud affirming buzz.\n\nThe General turns to hide a grin as he leaves, \"As you were.\"\n\nThe Cadets exchange a nervous glance over the chute. Probably nothing.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nSale Star\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item ID for Sale Star being \"LowerPricedChests\" implies that it might have had a different function than the one it launched with. Given that the item does not lower chest prices.",
