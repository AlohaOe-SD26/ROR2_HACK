    "notes": "The Remote Caffeinator is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nWhen activated, after 5 seconds an Eclipse Zero Vending Machine crashes down, dealing 2000% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a 16m radius with sweet spot falloff. The vending machine can then be interacted with up to 12 times for a base cost of 5 gold each time (scaling with difficulty), which dispenses up to 3 cans of soda within 25m at a time depending on how many allies are near. These cans gravitate towards the player or their allies when they get close, each healing 25% of the collector's maximum HP.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item will trigger any on-interaction items such as  Bundle of Fireworks and  Squid Polyp.\nEach entity is limited to one deployed vending machine, so upon deploying a new one, the previous one will be destroyed similar to the   Engineer's turrets.\nThis may be frustrating if the player tries to use the vending machine spawned by an   Equipment Drone, as it will be replaced frequently in the presence of nearby monsters. However, frequent respawning means the vending machine stays close to the player as they explore the stage, while potentially dealing damage to enemies when landing.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe vending machine allows for easy, repeated use of the Bundle of Fireworks and Squid Polyp while in boss arenas or other areas which do not typically have interactables. A few stacks of Fireworks and a  Pocket I.C.B.M. can potentially make quick work of the final bosses, even on higher difficulties.\nThis strategy requires gold to function, and is therefore unusable during the first phase of the   Voidling fight, before normal enemies spawn. However, having a  Brittle Crown or  Roll of Pennies will help this strategy become viable during the fight.\n  Captain can call down a   Hacking Beacon near the vending machine, which will repeatedly and automatically activate it for free (triggering on-interaction items in the process). This strategy does not work in Hidden Realms, however, since Captain cannot use   Orbital Supply Beacon in these stages.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"I sure am thirsty,\" Chen said as he filled a Lemurian with bullets.\n\nLuckily for him, he had found an Eclipse Remote Caffeinator aboard his vessel. Reaching in his pocket, Chen pressed the button marked with the Eclipse logo, and many systems began to whirr to life.\n\nHigh up in the atmosphere, a panel on the hull of the UES Safe Travels slid open with a clunk. Ready to be ejected, an Eclipse Zero Vending Machine (c2038) twinkled valiantly. Silently, the vending machine began its journey down to the surface.\n\nBack down on the planet, Chen was starting to run low on ammunition, and the Lemurians were closing in. But, just when the Lemurians were ready to tear Chen apart, who else but the Eclipse Zero Vending Machine came crashing down, squishing the Lemurians into a fine paste. Climbing up a mound of dead Lemurians, Chen entered 5 standard credits into the machine and ordered his favorite beverage, courtesy of the Eclipse Company. \"Wow, refreshing and life-saving! Eclipse, quenching thirsts no matter where you are!\" Chen smiled, grateful for Eclipse's galaxy-wide service and quality assurance.\n\nThis log entry was brought to you by Eclipse: The Galactic Quencher\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.2.0\nBug Fix\nFixed \u2018Remote Caffeinator\u2019 DLC equipment being locked permanently\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Equipment: Remote Caffeinator\n(Undocumented) This equipment cannot be picked up in game\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe company name \"Eclipse\" is a reference to   Eclipse mode, a highly challenging alternate game mode which progresses through a series of increasingly difficult modifiers. Since the vending machine is referred to with \"Eclipse Zero,\" and because Eclipse's levels range from 1 to 8, this may signify how the vending machine's healing makes the consumer's life easier, bringing their Eclipse level even lower than normal.\nIronically,   Eclipse 5 halves the soda's effectiveness, so the promise of life-saving beverages rings somewhat hollow in a real Eclipse run.\nThe vending machine displays 6 soda cans with most likely another 6 behind them. When the interactable has fewer than 6 activations left, this will be depicted in the display accordingly.",
