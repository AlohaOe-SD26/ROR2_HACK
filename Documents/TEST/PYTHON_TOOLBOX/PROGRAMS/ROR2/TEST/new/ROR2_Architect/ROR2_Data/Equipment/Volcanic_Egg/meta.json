    "notes": "The Volcanic Egg is an equipment introduced in the Skills 2.0 Update.\nWhen activated, the player transforms into a fireball for 5 seconds, which detonates for 800% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 after 5 seconds have passed or by using the interact key. \nWhile in fireball form, the player can fly but cannot use skills; they are forced to travel forward at a constant speed towards their crosshair and control their trajectory by moving the camera. Flying into an enemy deals 500% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and resets the 5 second time limit, allowing the player to remain in fireball form indefinitely as long as they can keep hitting enemies.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe player can only damage each enemy once by flying through it per equipment use.\nThe player can still be damaged while in fireball form, so use some caution when flying towards dangerous enemies.\nDue to the interruptive nature of the transformation, it is not recommended that the player use this item alongside  Gesture of the Drowned.\nThis equipment's flight can be used to gain access to hard-to-reach locations, or simply to enhance the holder's mobility.\nThe speed of the fireball form does not scale with movement speed.\nHaving the equipment trigger while the character is using certain skills will allow the player to continue attacking while in fireball state, as long as the attack button is held down.\nThis can be done with   MUL-T's   Auto-Nailgun and   Power-Saw, but if the player is using   Power Mode, only the Primary placed into the first slot will function properly.\n  CHEF's   cleavers can be fired, held, and recalled normally this way, but in order to fire a new set of cleavers, the player will need to exit the fireball state due to having to let go of the Primary key.\nCertain abilities that fire for an extended amount of time upon pressing the attack key, such as   Artificer's   Flamethrower,   CHEF's   Sear, and   False Son's   Laser of the Father, will continue to fire while in fireball state.\nThe charged slam of   False Son's   Club of the Forsaken can be charged and released while in the fireball state. By releasing it during the fireball state, the player can build up fall distance, allowing them to increase the slam's radius, bounce height, and proc coefficient.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Europan Great Dragon Egg\n\nTracking Number: 00****************\n\nEstimated Delivery: 10/04/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Biological / Fragile\n\nShipping Address: Xenobiology Wildlife Reserve, Titan\n\nShipping Details: \n\nMake sure to keep this thing nice and hot while it incubates.
