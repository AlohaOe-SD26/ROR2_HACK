    "notes": "The Faulty Conductor is a boss item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the  Alloyed Collective expansion and dropped by the   Alloy Hunter.\nEvery 15 (-20% per stack) seconds, the user releases a wave of electricity that energizes nearby allies for 7 seconds. Energized allies gain +30% attack and movement speed, and ALWAYS land critical strikes with electric items and attacks.\n\n\n== Activating ==\nDamage from the following items is electrical:\n\n Ukulele\n Luminous Shot\n Faraday Spur\n Kinetic Dampener\n Unstable Tesla Coil\n N'kuhana's Opinion\n Electric Boomerang\n Genesis Loop\n Little Disciple\n Charged Perforator\n Polylute\n Saut\u00e9ed Worms\n Preon Accumulator\n Royal Capacitor\n Silence Between Two Strikes\n Wake of Vultures (by extension)\n N'kuhana's Retort (Projectile only)\nDamage from the following skills is electrical:\n\n  Artificer's   Plasma Bolt,   Charged Nano-Bomb, and   Ion Surge.\n  Loader's   M551 Pylon and   Thunder Gauntlet (AoE only).\n  Captain's   Power Tazer and   Beacon: Shocking (when first launched).\n  False Son's   Meridian's Will and   Lunar Stakes (AoE only).\nDamage from the following drones is electrical:\n\n  Bombardment Drone\n    ADMIN-OVERRIDE\nMultiple enemy attacks are also tagged as electrical.\n\n  Wandering Vagrant\n  Jellyfish\n  Overloading Worm (projectiles)\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis particular boss item is extremely rare. While any other boss item can drop naturally from fighting the associated Teleporter Boss at any point during a run, Faulty Conductor only appears during the   Conduit Canyon stage's Teleporter Boss, which can only be fought once per run.\nA  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn,  Recycler, Overgrown 3D Printer, or the Artifact of Prestige can help make it easier to find this item for the logbook entry.\n5 Faulty Conductors are needed for the time between pulses to be shorter than the duration of the buff, allowing the buff to be active permanently.\nAdditional stacks are not helpful to the player that has them, since the only benefit of stacking is decreased time between pulses.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nLab Dissection Analysis File\n\nSubject: Faulty Conductor\n\nTechnician: C.
