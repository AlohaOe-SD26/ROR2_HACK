    "desc": "Moving around builds up charge , granting up to +160% movement speed and +200% jump height at 100%. At 25% charge or higher, jumping triggers an explosive discharge for 400% (+280% per stack) damage in a 5m to 32.3m (+7.5m per stack) area.",
    "notes": "The Faraday Spur is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Alloyed Collective expansion.\nWhen the user moves around, they build up a charge, increasing their movement speed and jump height as the charge increases. When the charge is at 25% or higher, and the user jumps, it triggers an explosive discharge for 400% damage (+280% per stack) in a 5m to 32.3m (+7.5m per stack) area.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nBug: The visual radius shown is only half the radius of the attack.\nClarification: This item increases Jump-Power by 200%, which effectively increases Jump-Height by 800%.\nJump Power decreases the amount of fall damage you take, allowing you to run off cliffs with less worry.\nHowever this is lost upon activation, with high enough %, the jump will result in you taking fall damage on flat ground.\nSurvivors with vertical maneuverability options not involving jumping can use this item for its movement speed in stage traversal.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Faraday Spur \n\nTracking Number: 713***** \n\nEstimated Delivery: 01/19/2056 \n\nShipping Method:  Standard Shipping\n\nAddress: Company Headquarters, Silverton, Outer Rim \n\nShipping Details: \n\nReplacement Faraday Spur ordered by (company name illegible) for electricity mining. \n\nSafety protocols require that each employee in the field must be wearing a set of Faraday Spurs. \n\nWARNING: Both spurs are required for optimal protection. Failure to properly utilize these tools can result in an increased risk of electrocution in highly charged environments.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAlloyed Collective\nAdded New Item: Faraday Spur",
