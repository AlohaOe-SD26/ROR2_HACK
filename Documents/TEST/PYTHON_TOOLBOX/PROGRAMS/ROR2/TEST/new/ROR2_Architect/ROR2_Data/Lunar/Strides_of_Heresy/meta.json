    "notes": "The Strides of Heresy are a lunar item introduced in the Skills 2.0 Update and an original part of the Heresy Set. They are unlocked and start appearing in runs after completing the Blockade Breaker Challenge.\nObtaining the Strides of Heresy will replace the Survivor's utility skill (Shift by default on keyboard) with the Shadowfade skill.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nShadowfade's duration is increased when stacking Strides of Heresy. High stacks can result in more time out of reality than in, which can be excessive without something like  N'kuhana's Opinion.\nShadowfade will not prevent damage from Shrines of Blood, nor environmental damage such as fall damage or suffocation damage in the   Void Fields.\nShadowfade does not remove damage over time effects when activated.\nEntering a wormhole from the  Eccentric Vase immediately ends the duration of Shadowfade.\nObtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the   Heretic.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item is especially useful for   Commando and   REX (without their alternate utility skill unlocked), since Shadowfade is debatably an upgrade over their default utility skills.\n  Mercenary,   Loader,   Captain, and   Seeker have their damage outputs substantially lowered with their utility skills replaced.\nLoader in particular relies on her utility for the majority of her damage output, and as such Strides of Heresy should NEVER be taken on her unless the player is aiming to become the   Heretic.\nSeeker's utility skill   Sojourn does much of the same as Shadowfade, though you lose invincibility from Shrines of Blood and fall damage, as well as the explosion from exiting Sojourn.\n  Artificer gives up   Snapfreeze for Shadowfade, but can take unique advantage of the flight effect with her   ENV Suit. Hovering throughout the cooldown effectively grants her slow but unlimited flight, even without   Ion Surge.\nIt also gives Artificer a powerful defensive option for quickly falling back from danger. While Ion Surge is definitely a strong option for retreating, it still pales in comparison to complete invulnerability. Extra healing also ensures she can get back into the fight faster after sustaining damage.\nFor all other characters, such as   Huntress,   Bandit,   Railgunner,   False Son,   Chef and   MUL-T, this item is more of a toss-up, and up to user preference.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cHer legs were scattered to the two poles of the moon, twisted in a wicked position, in a field of obsidian thorns\u2026\"\n\n-The Evisceration of Kur-skan the Heretic, V\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix   Shadowfade not being usable by   Captain in hidden realms\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nNo longer puts you in combat\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nBug Fixes\n\ud83c\udf27 Fix a variety of effects still showing when using Strides of Heresy\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Strides of Heresy\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Lunar Item: Strides of Heresy\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe foreign leg resembles that of the   Alloy Vultures.\nSpecifically, it is one of the legs of   Kur-skan the Heretic.",
