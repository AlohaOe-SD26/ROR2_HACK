    "notes": "Growth Nectar is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nThe holder of this item gains a 4% increase to all stats for every unique buff that is currently active, up to 4 buffs (+4 per stack). \nAll the stat increases are multiplicative, after all other item stats have been added, which may be worse for some stats and better for others.\nThe 'all stats' of this item does not include acceleration.\n\n\n== Valid Buffs ==\n\n\n=== Survivor Buffs ===\nSome survivors have innate buffs that count toward this item:\n\n  Bandit:\n  Smoke Bomb counts as 2 (invisibility and speed).\n  Desperado stacks count as 1.\n  MUL-T:\n  Transport Mode is 1.\n  Power Mode is 1.\nTransport Mode and Power Mode cannot be used together, but one is often active.\n  Mercenary:\n  Eviscerate immunity grants 1.\n  Void Fiend:\nCorrupted state permanently grants 1.\nDuring transformations, 1 is briefly activated for immunity. This means that when corrupting, 2 are briefly active.\n  Seeker:\nTranquility stacks (grey petal) grant 1.\nSaving Grace (gold petal) grants 1. Saving Grace can also be sent to other players, and is lost on death.\n  CHEF:\n  Roll briefly grants 1.\n  Yes, CHEF! grants 1 when queued up.\n  False Son:\n  Step of the Brothers briefly applies 1.\n  Meridian's Will applies 1 while   Energized Core is active.\n\n\n=== Item Buffs ===\nThe following items can apply buffs passively or on use which count toward this item:\n\n Medkit (for two seconds after taking damage)\n Warbanner (when in radius)\n Oddly-shaped Opal (when effect is ready)\n Bolstering Lantern (enemies/allies in radius)\n Chronic Expansion (on kill)\n Elusive Antlers (when picking up orbs)\n Warped Echo (when effect is ready)\n Hiker's Boots (while effect is active)\n Berzerker's Pauldron (on activation)\n Kjaro's Band or  Runald's Band (when effect is ready) (both items count as the same buff)\n Old War Stealthkit (on low health) (counts as 2 for stealth and speed)\n Predatory Instincts (active on critical hits)\n Red Whip (not used combat skills recently)\n War Horn (on equipment use)\n Hunter's Harpoon (on kill)\n Shuriken (1 or more available)\n Breaching Fin (when effect is ready)\n Luminous Shot (1 or more shots charged)\n Prayer Beads (1 or more stacks)\n Unstable Transmitter (when effect is ready)\n Collector's Compulsion (while effect is active)\n Faraday Spur (while charged at least 1%)\n Brainstalks (on killing elite)\n Resonance Disc (after kill, active while charges count down)\n Unstable Tesla Coil (when tesla active)\n Wake of Vultures (on killing elite) (10 different possible buffs)\n Ben's Raincoat (when effect is ready)\n War Bonds (when sufficient money is collected or at the start of the stage)\n Sentry Key (permanent while held)\n Prison Matrix (permanent while held)\n Safer Spaces (when effect is ready)\n Weeping Fungus (active while sprinting)\n Singularity Band (when effect is ready)\n Ultimate Meal (while effect is active)\n Mercurial Rachis (when in radius)\n Longstanding Solitude (1 or more purchases available)\nThe following equipment:\n\n Gorag's Opus\n Jade Elephant\n Ocular HUD\n Super Massive Leech\n Spinel Tonic\n Deus Ex Machina (while blessed after a successful parry)\nEvery elite aspect\nAdditionally, the Shrine of Shaping, which grants an   extra life, is considered a buff.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nClarification: This item increases max health, movement speed, damage, attack speed, crit, regen, and armor.\nUnlike other movement speed increases, acceleration is not increased here, potentially leading to feeling \"slippery\".\nMultiplicative crit chance is far less beneficial than linear.\nMultiplicative armor is not beneficial if you do not any armor granting items or are playing a survivor with base armor.\nUnlike  Irradiant Pearl, it does affect all armor, not just base armor.\nThe   Growth Nectar Buff does not count towards the 4 (+4 per stack) buffs.\nThis does not mean it counts as a debuff; whether or not a buff counts is manually set by the developers.\nThe stat boosts given by this item are multiplicative, similiar to  Spinel Tonic.\nIndividual stacks of   Growth Nectar Buff are immediately added/removed as other unique buffs are added/removed.\nThe following items do not count as a buff:\n Cautious Slug\n Rose Buckler\n Frost Relic\n Genesis Loop\n\n\n== Lore ==\nONE MASK.\nLARGE, OF OUR RESTING BONES\nI PULL FROM DEEP FERTILE SOIL.\nI COAT IT IN A ROYAL GLAND - THIS IS FOR GROWTH.\nI GIVE IT RED LENSES - THESE ARE FOR PRECISION\nI STEEP IN SHINING NECTAR - THIS IS FOR ASCENSION.\nSTAND AND BE WELCOME, FIRST DAUGHTER OF PARADISE.\nLET US SHOW YOU OUR GARDEN.\nAND YOU WILL SHOW US HOW TO PROTECT IT.\nTO THE COLONY THE SEED, TO US THE NECTAR.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nPrior to version 1.3.6, this item's simplified description was \"Survivors with 5 or more buffs are marked for greatness.\", a reference to the description for the  Death Mark.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.7\nGrowth Nectar now grants 4% increase to all stats (down from 7%) for each buff, up to a maximum of 4 (+4 per stack.) No longer increases base stat increase with additional stacks.\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nGrowth Nectar\nOld Functionality - While benefiting from 5+ unique buffs gain 20% (+20% per stack) bonus stats for 5 seconds.\nNew Functionality - Grants 7% (+7% per stack) increase to ALL stats for each buff, up to a maximum of 4 (+4 per stack).\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nGrowth Nectar",
