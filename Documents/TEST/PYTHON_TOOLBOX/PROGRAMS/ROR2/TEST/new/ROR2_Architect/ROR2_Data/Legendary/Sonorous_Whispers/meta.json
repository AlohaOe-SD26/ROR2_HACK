    "notes": "Sonorous Whispers is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nWhile holding this item, killing a boss will always cause an item to spawn. Additionally, elite enemies have a 5% chance (+1% per stack) to drop an item on death.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of 4% (+1% per stack) chance and both patch notes stating 4% (+1% per stack) chance are incorrect.\nWhen a drone is credited for the kill no item will drop.\nDrone kills with   ADMIN-OVERRIDE will drop an item however.\nOnly final phase of   final boss and   False Son will drop items.\nElite bosses may drop 2 items at once. One item drop is guranteed for bosses and it is possible to get second item from the same enemy for being an Elite.\nThe loot table for the item drops caused by this item is as follows:\n\n\n== Lore ==\nA tidepool lapped gently at the silty edge of the grotto.\nA soldier clumsy with darkness scrounged for supplies on the shoreline, a broken arm bound in splint and linen.\nA small chest is emptied, something stowed in the pocket of the soldier.\nA conch next, heavy with silt, he holds it to his ear.\nA drip of red trails his neck, stemming from his ear, unnoticed in the dark.\nA turn to leave the grotto, he spots a small chest once again sealed.\nA soldier empties it once more with a shaking hand.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nSonorous Whispers - reduced the item drop rate from elites to 4% but retained the guaranteed drop from large monsters.\nCorrection: Actually increased elite drop rate from 3% to 5%.\nBlacklisted  Unstable Transmitter,  Breaching Fin and Sonorous Whispers from situations where enemies can obtain items (such as Simulacrum.)\nSeekers of the Storm - First Patch\nSonorous Whispers had an issue where the drop chance of items could become extremely high, especially later into runs. This has been re-balanced to be more realistic. Elite item drop chance: 15% (+5% per stack) -> 4% (+1% per stack). Logbook change is still pending.\nCorrection: Actually decreased elite drop rate to 3%.\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nSonorous Whispers",
