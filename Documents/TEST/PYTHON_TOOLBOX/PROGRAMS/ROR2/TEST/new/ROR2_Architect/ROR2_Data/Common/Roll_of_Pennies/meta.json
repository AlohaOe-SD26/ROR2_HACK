    "notes": "The Roll of Pennies is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nWhenever the holder takes damage, they gain gold equal to 12% the cost of a Small Chest. This value starts at 3 gold (+3 per stack) and is multiplied by the difficulty coefficient. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description mentioning that the damage must originate from an enemy is incorrect, the item's effect is triggered for sources of damage originating from a character other than the holder of the item.\nThis means self-damaging effects, such as the  Helfire Tincture,   REX's \"plant\" skills,   Captain's Diablo Strike, and   Void Fiend's Corrupted Suppress do not trigger it.\nHowever, in Multiplayer,   Captain's Diablo Strike and  Helfire Tincture can be used by a different player on this item's holder to gain extra money, while the former is an extremely impractical method, the latter is very profitable to an almost gamebreaking degree earlygame: since the hellfire damage ticks 5 times per second and lasts up to 15 seconds, activating it will trigger roll of pennies a total of 75 times for a gold amount equal to the price of 9 small chests, the total burn damage caused is 30% of the hellfire holder's max HP to themselves and 15% of the hellfire holder's max HP to the roll of pennies holder's HP (this means that, depending on how much health the hellfire holder has, the roll of pennies holder will take varying amounts of damage), but both values can be reduced drastically with even a single  Repulsion Armor Plate or  Planula, or compensated with any healing items.\nThe {  Void Fog and fall damage also do not trigger it as they are sources of damage not linked to any character.\nThe explosive containers in   Abandoned Aqueduct and   Rallypoint Delta do trigger it as they are immovable characters.\nA projectile or persistent attack, such as the   Mini Mushrum's Blazing Pool, that hits the player after the enemy has died will not trigger the effect. Dying here does not mean the enemy's health reaching zero, but the enemy's death animation completing. As such, the   Lunar Chimera's (Exploder) death effect will not trigger the item since the blazing pool in this case spawns after the death animation has finished.\nAn animation of a flying gold coin will play when this item's effect activates, and the animation will show more coins the more stacks the player has.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item activates on any instance of enemy damage, regardless of its proc coefficient. This includes damage over time effects, which will activate the item's effect for every individual tick of damage.\nThis means that intentionally letting enemies inflict {  Burn or {  Bleed can be an effective way to rapidly generate money, especially when combined with a  Repulsion Armor Plate to mitigate the damage. Note that  Ben's Raincoat renders this strategy somewhat less effective.\nTaking damage from a   Solus Probe's beam, or standing in the damage zone of a   Mini Mushrum's spore bomb are also effective ways to generate money.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe sounds of gunfire rang in Johnson's ears. Biting down and tugging on the bandage covering his wounded leg, he hastily reloaded his firearm.\n\nFor a moment, before he fired on the Lemurians who had pinned his team into a corner and already claimed two of his friends, Johnson reflected on what brought him here.\n\nJohnson had grown up in poverty, the oldest of three children. He had started working at a young age to support his sick mother and younger siblings, and all his life he bounced from one odd job to the next. Anything that could rake in the cash. Anything that would pay the bills.\n\n\"'An expedition into unknown territories, seeking volunteers,'\" his recruiter read in between puffs of his cigar. \"Lot of classified info, don't know too much myself... But it pays a lot. And I know you need the money. You in, Johnny-boy?\" At the time, Johnson had thought to himself, 'it couldn't be that bad.'\n\nJohnson returned to the battlefield, gunning down Lemurians in an effort to save his remaining friends. The wound on his leg ached, dying the bandage red with blood. 'It couldn't be that bad,' he had thought. \"Yeah, right.\" Johnson scoffed. \"At least I'm getting paid after this.\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Roll of Pennies\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nLooking closely at the penny's model in the logbook shows that instead of reading \"In God We Trust\" like a standard United States penny, it reads \"In Paul We Trust.\" This is a reference to Paul Morse, one of the two founders of Hopoo Games, who also has  Paul's Goat Hoof named after him.\nThere is also a stone golem carved on the back of each penny.",
