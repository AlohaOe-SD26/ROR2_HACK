    "notes": "The Spare Drone Parts are an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nThe holder gains an ally,   Colonel Droneman, who respawns every stage if destroyed. All the holder's allied drones get +25% attack speed (+25% per stack), have their cooldowns reduced by 25% (-25% per stack), have a 10% chance to fire a missile on hit that deals 150% total damage (similar to the  AtG Missile Mk. 1), and get a chain gun that fires 6 shots for 50% damage each which can ricochet to 2 other enemies.\n\n\n== Drone Skills ==\nCol. Droneman has no innate skills, essentially being just a filler drone to make the item better if the owner has few or no drones.\nHe does however have a unique activation for   Operator\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item empowers all owned minions tagged as Mechanical, not just Drones.\n  Engineer's turrets.\nSince the turrets have items in their inventory, both the chain gun and the missile can proc them.\nThe probes summoned by the  Empathy Cores. Although no visible gun is added to the probes, they will still utilize its attack.\nGummy clones of   MUL-T,   REX and   CHEF spawned with  Goobo Jr., since they are considered mechanical. Gummy Engineer turrets also benefit.\n  Solus Probe,   Solus Control Unit and   Alloy Worship Unit ghosts spawned by the  Happiest Mask.\nThis item is meant to work on Devoted Lemurians but does not due to a bug.\nInstead it works on wild Lemurians, which can be recruited by Happiest Mask.\nAlthough they may seem like they should benefit, the   Squid Turret summoned by the  Squid Polyp and the allied   Alpha Construct from the  Defense Nucleus are not affected by the Spare Drone Parts.\nSince the   Equipment Drone is affected by the Spare Drone Parts, it can attack enemies without using its equipment. This also means equipment that were previously useless for Equipment Drones, like the  Ocular HUD, may have newfound purpose.\nIf the Equipment Drone has a Goobo Jr., the Gummy Equipment Drones spawned will also be affected by the Spare Drone Parts. The same goes for Strike Drones summoned if the Equipment Drone has The Back-up.\nIf the Artifact of Swarms is active, one Spare Drone Parts will result in two Col. Dronemen spawning with half health.\nThe chain gun gained from the Spare Drone Parts is attached to the existing spinning guns on   Gunner Drones and   TC-280 Prototypes, meaning the extra gun will flail wildly when the main one is firing.\nWhen this item is lost, e.g., with a Scrapper, Shrine of Order, or 3D Printer, Col. Droneman will not be removed as an ally. Whenever getting this item, the player will always gain a copy of Col. Droneman, even if they already have one. This can be observed when the   final boss steals the item in his final phase and it is later returned to the player.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nBe advised that when Mithrix steals this item during his fourth phase, he will not gain a Col. Droneman himself but will leave the player's droneman defenseless by removing all bonuses to any drones the player has. (Col. Droneman does not actually have any attacks and its only source of damage is the generic chaingun that every drone gets when holding this item)\nWhen the item is returned, the player will obtain a second Col. Droneman and both drones will obtain the chaingun as well (assuming the first one survives until then).\nThis item augments damage drones, while providing healing and utility drones an attack to contribute in offensive ways.\nThis item synergizes well with a   Captain drone build. While   his passive provides defensive measures against most monsters, the Spare Drone Parts allows drone minions to deal considerably more damage.\nAlthough it is tempting to gather as many drones as possible, keep in mind the ally limit of 15; past this point, allies cannot be spawned by items or equipment (e.g. the Empathy Cores or The Back-up). If too many small drones or non-drone allies are on the team, these more powerful drone allies cannot be summoned once destroyed, lowering the team's damage output. This may not be much of an issue, however, since the weaponry provided by the Spare Drone Parts is so powerful to begin with.\n\n\n== Lore - Item ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"Y'see those new drone models they approved for us? Never thought I'd see 'em in person, if I'm being honest.\"\n\n\"Yeah, for sure. Only the big wigs had access to tech like that... Makes you wonder what we're up against. I mean, everyone's heard the stories, but...\"\n\n\"Ah, I wouldn't worry. After all, y'know my buddy Jim?\"\n\n\"From hardware?\"\n\n\"Yeah, him. Dude's a savant, let me tell you. He got fired from every other branch he worked at for \"unlawful modification of company property,\" and \"weapons systems beyond what's legal for citizens to own\".\"\n\n\"Huh. Crazy.\"\n\n\"Mhm. I recommended him for this mission, since I figured we'd need everything we could get our hands on... Luckily, the Captain saw his potential. I just, uh...\"\n\n[Fire alarms begin to sound as a fire breaks out in Workshop 23-B. Drones, equipped with buzzsaws, chase technicians down the hall]\n\n\"...Hope he doesn't mind the noise.\"\n\n\n== Lore - Drone ==\n\"This statue is dedicated to the TCX line of drone units. Commonly known as 'the bloodiest conflict in human history', the tides of the War of 2019 were completely changed by escalating drone technologies, entirely replacing allied boots-on-the-ground deployments with machines-in-the-air by the end of the war. \n\nThe TCX-55, known by those with whom he served as \"Colonel Droneman\", as well as other similar less-noteworthy prototypes, were significant for their ability to interface with and parallel compute for other drones in use by UES-affiliated militaries, allowing for a significant increase in firepower per drone, with a TCX unit handling their targeting and routing routines.\n\nColonel Droneman is highly regarded for its extraordinary character and integrity as well as its unique vision on leadership and combat tactics. Having conducted over 90 operations against Aeonian frontlines and strongholds, Drones under operation of Colonel Droneman were highly feared by enemy forces, deploying previously unseen tactics whilst evading fire and dispatching enemies - many modern principles of drone combat, such as sticking near walls to avoid detection, or keeping distance from vulnerable targets for an opportune time to strike, have been derived from the ingenious strategies first deployed by the Colonel.\n\nColonel Droneman is still proudly in UES service as of [2056], and was currently last in-use by [Deimos military] in [the Boron System].\"\n\n-Exhibit at The National WW19 Museum\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.2.0\n Spare Drone Parts no longer grants Col. Droneman to   Engineer Turrets\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Spare Drone Parts\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Spare Drone Parts are the successor to an item in the first Risk of Rain, the Arms Race, which worked in a similar manner.\nThe extra chain gun from the Spare Drone Parts can be seen mounted on each individual drone. However, there is a 10% chance that a small mechanical arm holding a gun will be mounted on the drone instead. This difference is purely cosmetic.\nSpare Drone Parts used to grant Col. Droneman to Engineer Turrets.",
