    "notes": "The Halcyon Seed is a boss item introduced in the Scorched Acres Update, dropped by defeating   Aurelionite at Gilded Coast.\nUpon beginning a Teleporter Event, the player will lose all of their Halcyon Seeds and Aurelionite will spawn as an ally. She will fight for the player until the Teleporter is charged, at which point she will instantly die. The player will retrieve their Halcyon Seed when Aurelionite dies (regardless of whether she died at the end of the Teleporter Event or was killed in some other way). In multiplayer, players who die after Aurelionite is summoned will still recover their Halcyon Seeds when Aurelionite dies.\nThis item stacks based on the total amount held by all players combined (items held by   Engineer's   turrets do not count), similarly to the Lepton Daisy. Each Halcyon Seed beyond the first gives Aurelionite an additional 100% health and some extra damage.\nIf the player is fighting   Mithrix and is in phase 4, Aurelionite will spawn and help the player.\nIf the player is fighting the   False Son and is in phase 3, Aurelionite will spawn and fight against the player while keeping the increased stats from any excess stacks of Halcyon Seed. Defeating False Son in this way clears the Purified Freedom challenge and unlocks the   False Son as a playable survivor.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: While Aurelionite's Health increases by 100% per stack of Halcyon Seed, Aurelionite's Damage is actually equal to the square root of the number of stacks of Halcyon Seed rounded to the nearest 10%\n\nThe Halcyon Seed is one of the few blacklisted items that   Engineer's turrets will not inherit.\nIf theArtifact of Command is active when Aurelionite is defeated at Gilded Coast, a Yellow Command Essence will drop, but it will only allow this item to be selected.\nIf the Artifact of Swarms is active, two Aurelionites with half the normal health will spawn at Gilded Coast. However, only one Aurelionite will spawn during Teleporter Events.\nIf the player damages an allied Aurelionite via items such as  Helfire Tincture, she may attempt to attack them. However, she will not do any damage.\nThe   final boss has special dialogue if any Halcyon Seeds are brought to the fight. Upon seeing Aurelionite, he exclaims \"THE GUARDIAN...? IMPOSSIBLE...!\" or \"THE WRETCHED GUARDIAN!\" If he manages to defeat Aurelionite, he states either \"YOU CANNOT DEFY ME, GUARDIAN,\" or \"RETURN TO DIRT, GUARDIAN.\"\nThe   final boss also has a unique dialogue if the   Heretic has the Halcyon Seed: \"THE HERETIC\u2026 THE GUARDIAN\u2026 HOW? WHO PULLS YOUR STRINGS, VERMIN?\"\nWhen Aurelionite dies while allied with the player, she has a chance of dropping Aurelionite's Log.\nAurelionite can become   Voidtouched by a   Void Infestor, which causes her to attack players. This can become a serious problem during Teleporter Events if any Void Infestors are near.\nBe wary of attacking   Void Reavers that may be near Aurelionite, as she will make no attempt to avoid their death implosion and will be instantly killed.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nBrother, what is this...? Why is it misshapen and weak? Was there an error in my design?\n\nGuardian. Come to me. Allow me to see your construction.\n\n...\n\nSo I see.\n\nThese are not the correct ratios.\n\nThis is no minor error, Brother. You have purposefully deviated from the design. For what purpose have you done this? You cannot weave a construct from such an abundance of soul. You know it is too unstable - that it is too unpredictable and too frail. I have told you this, and yet you have wasted the materials I have gathered - and exhausted your own strength to fabricate this miscreation.\n\nTo what benefit?\n\nAt its best, it can be no more than an inferior servant; it is deficient in the compounds that were to give it fortitude and strength. At its worst, it will betray us.\n\nYou have created the first being of this world which threatens us. We cannot keep it here. Attempting to destroy it will risk its retaliation... I will prepare one of the vaults for it to be sealed away, while it is still young and naive.\n\nWhat a foolish mistake you have made, brother.\n\nI expect you to return the design to me. I cannot allow you to build another construct with so much power - and with such little control. I will build the rest of our guardians; by my hand, they will be weak, but at least they will be loyal.\n\nGo home. I will deal with this creature. We can discuss a better project for you when I return.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\nChanged summoned   Aurelionite pre-stack scaling from current-difficulty-based hp + damage bonuses to leveling up to the ambient level like other summoned characters\nSummoned Aurelionite attention span: 5s \u21d2 15s  Developer Notes: Aurelionite\u2019s raised attention span should make it less likely to get distracted by weaker monsters attacking it so it\u2019s more likely to spend its time fighting stronger monsters.\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Halcyon Seed\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27\ufe0e Friendly   Aurelionite now has special AI to be more aggressive\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Boss Item: Halcyon Seed",
