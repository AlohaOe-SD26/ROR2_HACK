    "notes": "The Helfire Tincture is a lunar equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Multikill! Challenge.\nWhen activated, a sphere of blue flames surrounds the holder for 12 seconds, continuously inflicting the invisible {  Helfire debuff on everything within 15 meters (including the holder and their allies). Once a character leaves the fire or the Tincture's effect expires, the Helfire debuff persists for an additional 3 seconds. \nThe Helfire debuff deals damage 5 times per second. Each tick deals 0.5% of the holder's max health to themself, 0.25% of their max health to other allies, and 24% of their max health to enemies. This means that the damage per second is 2.5%, 1.25%, and 120% of the holder's maximum health to themself, to allies, and to enemies, respectively.\nThe Helfire debuff is nonlethal to the holder, so it will never bring them below 1 HP. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of dealing 5% of your maximum health to yourself and 2.5% to allies is technically correct, but does not account for how all friendly-fire damage (including self-inflicted damage) is halved.\nCorrection: The in-game description of 8m radius is incorrect, and the description does not specify the duration.\nSurvivors with natural armor take less damage from Helfire Tincture.\nIt's possible to gain permanent uptime of the flames by having a  Gesture of the Drowned and at least 4  Fuel Cells, though proper preparations must be taken to ensure the player can stay alive.\nAlthough the Helfire debuff is invisible, it still counts towards the  Death Mark.\nHowever, the  Ignition Tank changes the Helfire debuff into {  Stronger Burn, which will combine with other affected fire sources such as  Gasoline.\n Ignition Tank provides increased burn damage to enemies and yourself making the choice risky but powerful. Despite the increased self damage, the burn  is never lethal.\nAllies can still die from the burn caused by  Ignition Tank, so be wary when using this combo near drones or other players.\n\n\n== Item Effects ==\n\n\n=== Beneficial ===\n Tougher Times can block self-damage ticks.\n Repulsion Armor Plate reduces the damage taken while on fire, and because it ticks extremely fast for low amounts, it's easy to reduce burning damage taken to 1.\nCombining Armor Plates with the  Planula can result in a steady healing over time effect. This theoretical build is limited by Planula\u2019s scarcity.\nSince the  Focus Crystal is a global damage increase, it will increase the damage done to burning enemies. However, its range is slightly smaller than the flames' area of effect (13m versus 15m), so the player will need to get slightly closer to enemies to reap the benefits.\nFocus Crystal will give a damage boost against allies including other players.\n Razorwire will activate each tick of burning, firing 5 times per second and rapidly triggering on-hit effects.\nPairing the Razorwire with on-hit healing from the  Leeching Seed or  Harvester's Scythe gives the player automatic healing as long as enemies are within the Razorwire's range.\nAn Aegis can add a considerable barrier with enough on-hit healing.\nStacking Tougher Times will occasionally prevent the Razorwire from activating. It is important to find a balance between Tougher Times, Razorwire, and on-hit healing.\n Titanic Knurl,  Infusion,  Bison Steak,  Pearl,  Irradiant Pearl, and  Stone Flux Pauldron increase the damage dealt by the flames while simultaneously increasing survivability.\nHaving more max health increases the damage dealt, but likewise increases the damage taken, so more Repulsion Armor Plates are necessary. Taking 1 Repulsion Armor Plate per 1000 max health reduces each self-damage tick to 1.\n Mired Urn helps the player automatically heal when close to enemies, and inflicts {  Tar to slow them down and keep them in the burning area. It also pairs well with Focus Crystal by draining even more health.\nHaving two  Bustling Fungi allows the player to stand still and recover HP at a higher rate than the Tincture burns them.\n Weeping Fungus can accomplish the same thing but allows the player to continue moving.\nAll of the healing strategies above are greatly enhanced by the  Rejuvenation Rack.\nThe  Corpsebloom's recovery ceiling is lower than the self-injury inflicted by the Tincture and still affords the bonus healing that Rejuvenation Rack does. However, the Corpsebloom prevents the player from healing excessively, making Aegis practically useless and damage from enemies difficult to recover from.\n Voidsent Flame will trigger on the player if the burn ticks while at full health. However, these explosions do not deal self-damage, resulting in a huge damage boost with no downside as long as they can stay at full health.   Aegis is the best way to accomplish this.\nWhile shields do make it more difficult to use this strategy, as long as the combined value of the player's health, shields, and barrier is greater than their combined maximum health and shields, Voidsent Flame will still trigger.\n Transcendence will make all burn damage negligible, as the player's max health becomes 1.\nThe same effect happens upon killing a {  Perfected Elite while holding the  Wake of Vultures.\nA lesser effect happens when the player gains the {  Overloading buff by killing an Overloading Elite while holding the Wake of Vultures, where half of their max health becomes shields. This means that, for the duration of the Overloading buff, all damage taken from and dealt by the Tincture is halved.\n\n\n=== Detrimental or useless ===\n Medkit is near-useless because of how rapidly the burn damage ticks, constantly resetting the 2 seconds necessary to recover. The only way to make use of a Medkit is to proc Tougher Times many times in a row.\nThe barrier from  Topaz Brooch is consumed almost instantly, and\u2014in the late-game\u2014the stack requirement becomes too high to be sustainable.\n Personal Shield Generator and all shield effects do not increase the damage dealt, and shields require 7 seconds without taking damage to replenish.\n Cautious Slug will never activate because the player is constantly taking damage.\n Rose Buckler can reduce incoming burn damage, but the effect is considerably smaller than a single Repulsion Armor Plate. The armor granted is still useful for approaching enemies.\n Shaped Glass should be avoided as the damage from this item is based on max health, not base damage. Halving your health will halve the damage that the Helfire Tincture deals.\nThe  Ignition Tank will multiply the damage on enemies and allies. Without plenty of healing, even one stack can make the self-burn damage get out of hand by dealing 10% of the user's maximum health per second as self damage.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n========================================\n====   MyBabel Machine Translator   ====\n====     [Version 12.45.1.009 ]   ======\n========================================\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <1453461 cycles>\nComplete!\nDisplay result?
