    "notes": "The Focused Convergence is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Never Back Down Challenge.\nIt makes Teleporters charge 30% (+30% per stack) faster, but decreases the charging radius by 50% (-50% per stack).\nThis item affects all holdout zones, including the cells on   Void Fields, the pillars on   Commencement, and the deep void signals on   Void Locus. Every time these zones are deployed, they expand at first to their normal size but then quickly shrink. The Teleporter zone is also colored blue instead of red to indicate that the Focused Convergence is in effect.\nIn multiplayer, this item stacks based on the total amount held by all players combined (items held by   Engineer's turrets do not count), similar to  Lepton Daisy. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Focused Convergence is one of the few blacklisted items that   Engineer's turrets will not inherit.\nThe maximum effect is achieved after three Focused Convergences are obtained. Any further Focused Convergences do nothing.\nKeep in mind that halving the holdout zone's radius reduces the ground area to a quarter, and the total volume of the zone to an eighth. This makes the drawback of this item much more noticeable than the player might expect.\nThis item only affects the Teleporter radius while the holder is alive; if a player holding Focused Convergences dies during the Teleporter Event in a multiplayer game, the Teleporter radius will expand accordingly.\nThe Teleporter radius will also change if the item leaves the player's inventory while it's charging, either by it being consumed by  Egocentrism or by trading it in a Cleansing Pool.\nThe rescue ship charge rate on Commencement is not affected by this item.\nThe charging zone for Pillars of Soul already become quite small when almost fully charged. They become extremely difficult to charge if the team has multiple stacks of this item.\nThis item cannot be obtained in the Simulacrum mode, and will appear locked if attempting to select it with the Artifact of Command.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nPlayers at   Eclipse level 2 or higher should avoid this item, since Eclipse will already reduce the Teleporter radius by half.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe minimum charge time is determined by the formula 90 / (1 + 0.3 \u22c5 amount)\nThe zone size is determined by the formula 1 / (2 \u22c5 amount)\n\nCharge time is the minimum charge time with all alive players in the Teleporter zone.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nGravity concentrating... falling inward, condensing, hardening.\n\nA singularity shrinks to the point your mind inverts, reversing reality. Now return. \n\nDon\u2019t the matters of the physical world seem trivial now? Your tasks in this realm are simple and hastened, all in an attempt to get reversed. How many times can you make this trip before you are claimed by its process? \n\nDo not let it take you. Take it instead. Here.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Now activates in all \u2018holdout zones\u2019, like   Void Fields, and not just during the Teleporter Event\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4892828)\nBug Fixes\nFix Focus Convergence from stacking with   Engineer Turrets\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lunar Item: Focused Convergence\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Focused Convergence\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item is based off of a fan-made idea with a similar effect. The idea received critical acclaim in the official RoR2 Discord for streamlining gameplay by reducing the wait time, while also making the Teleporter Event more engaging, which a lot of players wanted for a while.",
