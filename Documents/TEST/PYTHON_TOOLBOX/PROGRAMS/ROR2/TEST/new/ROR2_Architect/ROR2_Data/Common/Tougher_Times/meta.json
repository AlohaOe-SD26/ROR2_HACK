    "notes": "Tougher Times is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Learning Process Challenge.\nThe item grants a 15% (+15% per stack) chance of negating incoming damage.  If the roll is successful, the damage will be negated and a \"Blocked!\" message will appear instead of damage numbers.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nSelf-inflicted damage from the  Helfire Tincture, Shrines of Blood, and   REX's \"plant\" skills can be blocked.\nWhen a hit is blocked successfully, on-hit effects will not trigger. These include but are not limited to the lightning bombs from Overloading Elites,   Bleed,   Burn,   Poison, and   Weak.\nThe item will not block a   Void Reaver death implosion, since the implosion does not actually deal damage. Similarly,   Mercenary's invincibility on either of his utilities and his default special, and   invulnerability in general, will not block the implosions either.\nTougher Times is one of the few items in the game with Hyperbolic Stacking.\nThe corrupted version of this item, released in the Survivors of the Void expansion, is  Safer Spaces.\nTougher Times cannot block damage inflicted by the   Void Fog debuff.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe chance to activate is determined by the formula:\n\nWhere x is the amount.\nThe chance to block is not affected by  57 Leaf Clover or  Purity.\n\n\n=== Graph ===\n\nStep plot of block chance represented by y(x) = 1-(1/(0.15x+1)). Values correspond to table above.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM ROOM 4211B OF UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"Why'd you sign up?\"\n\nWyatt's voice was bored. The mission to the Contact Light's last known location was taking longer than he expected.\n\nMalik was on the floor, cleaning her rifle. \"To get paid, mostly.\"\n\n\"And that's it?\"\n\nShe grunted in affirmation. She continued to wipe down the weapon.\n\n\"I'm here to find something.\" He continued. \"I shipped it a few years back, but I don't think it made it before the train went down. I'm guessing it's still in the Contact Light. So I'm gonna get it back.\"\n\nShe began to tighten the last remaining bolts. Her routine near completion, she moved her gaze to Wyatt. \"Seriously?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n\nMalik raised her brow. \"There were over 7 million security chests in the Contact Light. The chance of you finding a specific one is impossible.\" She began to unfold her legs as she propped her rifle in the corner. \"And according to the distress beacon, the Contact Light was destroyed in orbit. Your shipment is probably floating around in space. It's all gone, Wyatt.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"I think I'm gonna find it.\"\n\n\"You're terrible.\"\n\n\n== Placement ==\n\n\n=== Survivors ===\n  Commando places it on the center of his upper back.\n  Huntress places it on her upper back, to the right.\n  Bandit places it on the center of his upper back.\n  MUL-T places it sitting atop the rear corner of its left shoulder.\n  Engineer places it on the center of his upper back.\n  Artificer places it on the back of her hoverpack's left engine, near the bottom.\n  Mercenary places it on the center of his upper back, over his afterburner.\n  REX places it sitting atop its body, to the left.\n  Loader places it on the center of her upper back.\n  Acrid places it impaled on one of its back quills.\n  Captain places it on his upper back, to the right.\n  Railgunner places it on her outer right thigh.\n  Void Fiend places it on the center of its upper back.\n  Seeker places it over the back of her right shoulder, facing backwards.\n  False Son places it upside-down on the side of his right shoulder, impaled by its spikes.\n  CHEF places it on the right side of its bag.\n  Operator places it sitting on top of his backpack's left side, facing left.\n  Drifter places it on the back of her bag, slightly to the left.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Non-Playable Characters ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Unused Characters ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Tougher Times no longer blocks suffocation damage while in the   Void Fields\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3961583)\nBug Fixes\nHitting Immune characters or blocked attacks no longer applies on-hit effects\nThis is especially important for   Mercenary, who was previously recieving debuffs like   burning and   malachite poisoning while Immune\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Tougher Times is actually the Tough Times from Risk of Rain 1, but in a tattered state. The Tough Times granted bonus armor, instead of a chance to negate damage.\nWhen a hit is blocked, a squeaky toy sound effect plays.\nPrior to the Survivors of the Void update, the suffocation damage from the   Void Fields could be negated by this item.",
