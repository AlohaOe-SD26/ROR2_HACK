    "notes": "The Warbanner is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen the holder levels up, or when a Teleporter Boss spawns, a banner appears at the holder's location. All allies within a 16m (+8m per stack) radius of a banner get the {  Warbanner buff, giving them 30% increased attack speed and movement speed. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nWhile the radius scales linearly, the area of the Warbanner's effect scales quadratically (Area = \u03c0 \u22c5 r\u00b2). This means that in multiplayer, it is stronger to stack this item on one player rather than across several players. 2 players with 1 Warbanner each would cover 1,608.5 square meters, while 1 player with 2 Warbanners would cover 1809.6 square meters.\nThe banner's area of effect is indicated by a large yellow sphere.\nThe Warbanner works well for   Engineer's   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets, since they cannot move out of the banner's area of effect and will always get the bonus attack speed.\nThe Warbanner is one of the few blacklisted items that Engineer's turrets will not inherit.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nHeavy losses were expected \u2013 after all, the invaders were as cunning as they were deadly. \n\nThe dust had at last settled. The Golems had returned to the earth, and the Lemurians had returned to their tunnels. It was a long and grueling battle, but they had won. The invaders had been purged.\n\nThe only proof of their last stand was a single banner, fluttering in the wind, flying over a mountain of corpses.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Warbanner\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Now also places a Warbanner when activating the Teleporter\nImprove VFX to be less opaque, since it will always be near the Teleporter\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27Remove \u2018Damage\u2019 tag so it no longer spawns in Damage Chests\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nBug Fixes\nFix cropping issues on Warbanner icon",
