    "notes": "The Energy Drink is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhile sprinting, the holder's movement speed increases by about 17.24% (+17.24% per stack). After accounting for the movement speed multiplier when sprinting, this comes to a final speed bonus of 25% (+25% per stack) while sprinting.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item is stronger on Survivors who have the Agile keyword on their skills, such as   Mercenary,   Huntress, or   False Son.\nLike all speed-increasing items, grabbing an excessive amount will make it more difficult to maneuver.\nThe item does not raise the sprint speed multiplier; instead, it gives a movement bonus that only applies while sprinting. Because the multiplier is not affected, the Energy Drink does not improve other movement-related items, like  Paul's Goat Hoof.\nWhen compared to  Paul's Goat Hoof while sprinting, the hoof provides a 20.3% increase in speed, while the energy drink's is of 25%. Keep in mind that while the hoof is active at all times, the drink is only of use if the character is sprinting, this also means energy drinks are of no use to the   final boss on the last phase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: NR-G Sports Soda (400)\n\nTracking Number: 49******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 03/12/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Standard\n\nShipping Address: Venetian Health & Public Services, Ridgelake, Venus\n\nShipping Details:\n\nYeah, so, uh this is the um, the energy drink that people were mixing during that disaster in Majora Minora a few weeks ago. \n\nA quick toxicology test on some of the victims has come back positive for um... all kinds of stuff, really. Methadone, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol, a variety of opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines... the list just goes on and on and on.\n\nRadical Drinks is insisting that NONE of those were from their energy drink - which I find pretty uh, unlikely. Maybe they REALLY know how to party in Violet Heights, huh?\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Speed Boost: 30% (+20% per stack) \u21d2 25% (+25% per stack)  Developer Notes: Mathematically, the Energy Drink was worse than the Goat Hoof for speed after the first pickup, even while sprinting. This change will consistently make Energy Drink stronger when sprinting, and also makes its stacking behavior more consistent. This may make the Energy Drink too strong, but it\u2019ll at least make a bit more sense now.",
