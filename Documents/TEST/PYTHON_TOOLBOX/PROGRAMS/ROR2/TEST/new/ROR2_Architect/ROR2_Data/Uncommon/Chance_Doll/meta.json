    "notes": "Chance Doll is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nThe item has a 40% (+10% per stack) to replace an item from a shrine of chance success with a different item from a drop pool with higher rarity chances.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: Rather than replacing items with higher rarity ones, Chance Doll will spawn an item from a dedicated drop pool with the following weights:\n\nThis means that it is possible for Chance Doll to replace a legendary item with an uncommon one, although on average, item quality from shrines of chance will be higher with this item.\nWhen the Chance Doll procs, green particles emerge from the base of the shrine of chance and the message \"You offer to the shrine and are greatly rewarded!\" appears in chat.\nThis item is affected by luck.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nTwo reptilian figures walk deep into Stone territory, the smaller one carries a stone-string doll. Cairns and more dolls decorate the path.\n---\nI do as you say, I bring my friend Pebl, but I do not like it.\nFather, must we leave her?\n\nHumling, we must return Pebl to her first family.\nTo honor our agreement, we return her before your Humling days are behind you.\n\nI do as you say, I think she will like leaning here, do you?\nFather, where is her family?\nHumling, when the demon fell from the Sky, many families hid themselves away.\nTo protect her, her family will see the demon resolved before returning.\nI do as you say.\nFather, I will miss her.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nChance Doll - Functionality unchanged, updated the logbook entry to correctly display the 40% chance of increasing rarity of items from Shrines of Chance. When an item is successfully increased in rarity the text is now colored green in the chat log and green particles emit from the shrine.\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nChance Doll",
