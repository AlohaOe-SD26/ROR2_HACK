It is created by combining the  Encrypted Cerebellum with a  Sentry Key,  Prison Matrix,  Rusted Key,  Encrusted Key,  Empathy Cores or  Orphaned Core at the Wandering CHEF.\nThe item has no effect on the player, and is meant to be given to SPEX in the   Computational Exchange to open a Decrypted Portal to the   Neural Sanctum.\nIt is one of few items that the Artifact of Command has no effect on. Though a Yellow Command Essence will drop, it cannot be transformed into any item except the Exposed Cerebellum.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n========================================\n====   MyBabel Machine Translator   ====\n====     [Version 12.45.1.009 ]   ======\n========================================\nTraining\u2026 <100000000 cycles>\nTraining\u2026 <100000000 cycles>\nTraining\u2026 <100000000 cycles>\nTraining\u2026 <50912157 cycles>\nPaused\u2026\nDisplay partial result?
