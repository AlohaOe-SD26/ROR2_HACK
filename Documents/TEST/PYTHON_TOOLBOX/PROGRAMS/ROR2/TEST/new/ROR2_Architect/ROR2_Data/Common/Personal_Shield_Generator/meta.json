When the player's maximum health is halved, the amount of shields they gain is also reduced.\nThis item can benefit a player with  Transcendence, since it will increase the shield by a small degree.\nHowever,  Transcendence's maximum health increase does not affect the amount of shield gained from this item.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe extra shield is particularly useful with  Plasma Shrimp, as it can provide more reliable uptime of its effect.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"While the kinetic rating is very poor, the extremely cheap production costs of Hinon\u2019s Personal Barrier made it a great budget tool for hikers, sailors, and even daily commuters to be comfortable in harsh weather.
