    "notes": "The Planula is a boss item in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the   Grandparent.\nWhenever the holder takes damage, they immediately heal 15 HP (+15 HP per stack), making it extremely useful against monsters that attack with rapid, low-damage hits.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nDamage-over-time debuffs, fall damage and self-inflicted damage trigger the heal.\nDamage taken from Void Fog, however, does not.\nPlanula's healing is applied if the incoming hit does not ignore armor and before taking damage. As such it may prevent the holder from dying. However, this also means that the player will also not be at full health after the hit. (See Receiving Damage for more details for the order of events).\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Planula works well with the  Helfire Tincture to recoup HP lost while burning.\n  REX makes excellent use of the Planula, since it heals them when they pay HP for abilities.\nThis item can pair well with the  Repulsion Armor Plate to further mitigate damage, although both these items fall off in effectiveness as the difficulty increases.\nBoth of these item can prove to be a hindrance when fighting   Mithrix's final phase where the player's power is reset before reclaiming their items back. However, this mostly applies to weak, fast-hitting attacks, such as   Double Tap and   Auto-Nailgun.\nThis item can drastically reduce the self damage   Sojourn does, and paired with a  Repulsion Armor Plate can effectively cancel it out, making it ideal for use on   Seeker.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Yes \u2013 the egg. The grandparent incubates the eggs.\"\n\n\"And the child?\"\n\n\"The child lays the egg.\"\n\n\"And the egg becomes the\u2026?\"\n\n\"The parent.\"\n\n\"Okay. And the parent does what?\"\n\n\"Takes care of children \u2013 and the grandparent.\"\n\n\"And the grandparent is the youngest?\"\n\n\"Younger than the child, yes. But not the youngest.\"\n\n\"Who is the youngest?\"\n\n\"The parent.\"\n\n\"\u2026\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nBug Fixes\nFixed Planula\u2019s material not becoming invisible\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Boss Item: Planula\nAdded New Lore Entry: Planula\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nInside the egg, a tiny  Parent can be seen.\nWhile written to sound humorously confusing, this item's logbook entry suggests that the Parent species has a similar life cycle to that of stars; they start out normal-sized, expand into giants over time, and then collapse into smaller versions, which are the oldest. This may also explain why the species glows brightly, and why Grandparents have a \"sunlight\" attack.\nThis logbook entry predates the introduction of   Children in the Seekers of the Storm Update, potentially making this logbook entry a little confusing for players before this update.",
