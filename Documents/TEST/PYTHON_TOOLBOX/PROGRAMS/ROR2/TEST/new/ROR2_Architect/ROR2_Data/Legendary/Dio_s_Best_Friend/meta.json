    "notes": "Dio's Best Friend is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the The Lone Survivor Challenge.\nUpon dying, the holder will be revived after a few seconds. This will trigger any on-death effects, such as the ice explosions from Glacial Elites. Upon reviving, the holder gets 3 seconds of   invincibility, and the item is consumed.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Engineer's turrets can be revived by this item. Redeploying gives them a new, unused Dio's Best Friend (as long as Engineer's is unused).\nWhile activating the final cell event in the Void Fields, it is possible for enemies to receive Dio's Best Friend as a Legendary item. Players should be careful if this happens, since each enemy will be revived after death once with invulnerability. They can even be revived from death when the completion of the cell event kills all enemies.\nRevived enemies can drop items if the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled, making it a good way to farm items in the Void Fields.\nIf the Artifact of Metamorphosis is enabled, the player will revive as a new survivor.\nThe item's invulnerability does not protect the player from being instantly killed by the Nullifier Implosion from a   Void Reaver,   Void Jailer,   Void Devastator, and the   Voidling.\nVoidling's Nullifier kills on contact, rather than through a single implosion attack. Invulnerability from this item will be bypassed, effectively killing the player repeatedly through multiple revives.\nThe   final boss steals and can use this item, although it is unlikely to see this happen as items are typically given back to their original owners before his health can be reduced to zero, to activate the item.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nHey Dio,\n\nWow, you have gotten older since the last time I wrote! How old are you now \u2013 10? And so much grumpier, too. I\u2019ve never seen a cat so grumpy. What do you have to be grumpy about?\n\nDespite the fact that you are the pickiest eater I know \u2013 and love to meow all throughout the night, every night \u2013 it still makes me happy to hear you bounding down the stairs every time I come home. I like when I wake up and I see you sleeping across from me. I like when you sit at the dining table, like you\u2019re going to eat with us too. I like how you hit the power button every time you walk across my laptop. I like how shamelessly needy you are.\n\nPlease live a long life \u2013 I\u2019m needy too, and I\u2019d like that a lot.\n\nLove,\n\nDuncan\n\nPS would it kill you to purr for mama every now and then?\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Dio's Best Friend\nPC Patch v1.0.2.0\nBug Fixes\nFixed monsters revived via Dio\u2019s Best Friend potentially respawning into out-of-bounds kill zones that make them miss the trigger, never die again, and potentially cause a softlock in this way if they are a boss\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nConsumed Dio\u2019s is now considered unremovable, and the scrapper no longer gets clogged if somehow there is an untiered item inserted\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nBug Fixes\n\ud83c\udf27Update Dio\u2019s Best Friend on   Huntress to no longer clip into her scarf\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe name Dio is a reference to Duncan Drummond's cat. He is one of the developers of Risk of Rain. This can be found under the \"Team Section\" on the official site.\nIn Risk of Rain 1, the achievement to unlock this item is known as \"Sole Survivor\". This is a reference to a lyric in the song 'Holy Diver' by Dio, the artist from which Duncan's cat gets its name.\nThe logbook for this item, added in the Anniversary Update, is also written from his perspective as a letter to his cat.\nBefore the Skills 2.0 update, using a Shrine of Order made all consumed Friends disappear due to not having an item tier. Now, it simply leaves them alone.",
