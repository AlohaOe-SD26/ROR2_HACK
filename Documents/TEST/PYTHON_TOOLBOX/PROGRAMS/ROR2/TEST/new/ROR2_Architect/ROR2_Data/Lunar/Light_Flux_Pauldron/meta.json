    "notes": "The Light Flux Pauldron is an lunar item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nAfter all other cooldown reduction and attack speed modifiers are applied to the holder, this item reduces both their final attack speed and final cooldowns. Cooldowns are reduced by 50% (-50% per stack), while attack speed is multiplied by 1/(stacks + 1).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of halving attack speed per stack is incorrect. Only the first stack reduces attack speed by half; subsequent stacks have a lower penalty.\nBecause the Light Flux Pauldron's modification applies after all other changes, it makes attack speed bonuses less effective, and offers less of a cooldown reduction in the presence of other items that provide cooldown reductions.\nAfter applying the attack speed penalty, the game checks whether the value is less than 0.1 and sets it to that. Therefore, 9+ stacks will have the same effect on attack speed, assuming a starting value of 1.0.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Acrid can make good use of this item, as its utility skills (  Caustic Leap/  Frenzied Leap) and   Epidemic are not affected by attack speed. With a couple Light Flux Pauldrons, these skills can be rapidly used to great effect.\nHowever,   Vicious Wounds,   Neurotoxin, and   Ravenous Bite fire much more slowly, making them much less reliable.\n  Artificer is an excellent candidate for a Light Flux Pauldron because she is mostly cooldown-based. Her primary skills (  Flame Bolt/  Plasma Bolt) see great benefit from this item: just one stack will nearly allow for continuous firing of either primary skill. Both   Snapfreeze and   Ion Surge also benefit profoundly from cooldown reduction.\n  Flamethrower is severely weakened because attack speed determines its number of damage ticks per second, making it the lesser choice over   Ion Surge when carrying any stacks of Light Flux Pauldron.\nBoth secondary skills (  Charged Nano-Bomb/  Cast Nano-Spear) charge much more slowly. The   Charged Nano-Bomb is hurt worst, since   Cast Nano-Spear still provides the utility of freezing foes and executing low-health foes without needing to be fully charged.\nArguably, despite lowering their charge rate, a Light Flux Pauldron makes these abilities easier to use because they can be held for much longer without fully charging and automatically firing. To see any regular benefit from either secondary ability, it is recommended to take no more than one Light Flux Pauldron, as the charge rate and firing animation can become intolerably slow.\n  Bandit sees mixed results with this item. His primary skills (  Burst/  Blast) fire as quickly as the player can click, but are still negatively affected since they will take longer to reload with lower attack speed. Although   Smoke Bomb can be used to give a nearly permanent uptime of stealth with just one stack of this item, it does not deal much damage. His secondary skills  (  Serrated Dagger/  Serrated Shiv) and specials (  Lights Out/  Desperado) can be used more often, but the reduction in attack speed hampers their usefulness by making the firing animations of all of these abilities much slower.\nThe cooldown of his special skill (  Lights Out/  Desperado) is paused while he is firing it, meaning that the benefit of reducing their cooldown is offset by the drawback of delaying the start of their cooldown.(This needs testing)\n  Lights Out already fully resets itself and all of his abilities (and fully reloads his primary skill) when it executes a target, making Light Flux Pauldron especially ineffective with this skill.\nSimilarly to Bandit,   Huntress' kit changes drastically with this item. While it does hamper both   Strafe and   Flurry's rate of fire significantly and slows down   Laser Glaive's startup animation, it does allow the player to spam their secondary, utility and special (particularly   Ballista) abilities much more often. Taking this item essentially sacrifices the effectiveness of proc coefficient-dependant items and sustained damage for extra mobility and a more bursty damage output.\nThis item is excellent for   Captain's   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike, as just a single Pauldron will reduce the cooldown from 40s to 20s. The cast time of his   Orbital Supply Beacon will increase slightly, but is not that detrimental due to its limited use.\nKeep in mind that Captain's   Vulcan Shotgun will charge slower and have longer ending lag, however.\nThis item is difficult to use effectively on Survivors that scale heavily with attack speed.\nAssuming   Commando has no attack speed increases and a single Light Flux Pauldron, his   Suppressive Fire bullet count is reduced to a measly 3 bullets.\n  Engineer's   Bouncing Grenades,   Pressure Mines,   Spider Mines, and   Thermal Harpoons are all affected by attack speed.\nJust one Light Flux Pauldron allows for permanent uptime of   Bubble Shield.\nAlthough his special skills (  TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret/  TR58 Carbonizer Turret) can be placed or replaced much more frequently with the reduced cooldown, they will inherit this item and suffer from the poor attack speed. This makes them better candidates for strategies that rely on their disposability, such as using the  Fuel Array.\n  Heretic's   Hungering Gaze gets a longer cooldown and more bullets by stacking  Visions of Heresy. While it may seem useful to reduce the cooldown again using the Light Flux Pauldron, the decreased attack speed makes it more practical to just use one stack of Visions of Heresy instead.\n  Mercenary's signature {  Expose debuff leaves little use for this item, as hitting exposed enemies reduces skill cooldowns by 1 second. Even without this item, a skilled Mercenary player can constantly cycle through skills.\nUsing   Slicing Winds isn't affected by the negative attack speed, unlike   Eviscerate; making Slicing Winds more preferable if you are getting Pauldrons.\nInterestingly, by using more Light Flux Pauldrons, Mercenary will stay in his   Blinding Assault and  Focused Assault state for a much longer amount of time than normal.\n  Railgunner's   XQR Smart Round System,   M99, and   HH44 all fire much slower.   Supercharge not only takes longer to charge, but also disables her weapons for longer.\n  Active Reload scales with attack speed, changing the size of the perfect reload zone.\n  Loader isn't a bad pick with this item, as her   Grapple Fist and   Spiked Fist do not scale with attack speed, enabling incredible mobility. However, her barrier gain is significantly impacted, as   Charged Gauntlet and   Thunder Gauntlet take longer to charge and   Knuckleboom attacks slower.\n  MUL-T's   Blast Canister scales with attack speed, but can be immediately fired by sprint cancelling.   Transport Mode does not scale with attack speed, so the Light Flux Pauldron allows using both in quick succession for a very high damage rate.\n  REX with just one Light Flux Pauldron can achieve greater damage per second early on with   DIRECTIVE: Drill.   Tangling Growth can be maintained 100% of the time with ease thanks to the Pauldron's cooldown reduction, enabling excellent crowd control and healing.\nHowever, the firing speed of   DIRECTIVE: Inject is reduced, which hampers its damage and self-healing over time.\nWith enough Light Flux Pauldrons, the cast time for their utility skills (  DIRECTIVE: Disperse/  Bramble Volley) becomes high enough that REX can walk around during the delay between activating and actually firing the skill.\n  Void Fiend is terrible with the Light Flux Pauldron, as all its damaging skills are affected by lower attack speed.   Suppress and   Corrupted Suppress also take longer to cast, and have no cooldowns to begin with.\n\n\n== Math ==\nSkills' new cooldowns are determined by the formula cooldown \u22c5 0.5 ^ amount. Note that the minimum cooldown for most skills is 0.5 seconds.\nThe holder's final attack speed, however, is determined differently, with the formula attackSpeed \u22c5 1/(amount + 1).\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"The wind guides us all. Listen to the song of the wind, and dance according to its instruction. You will find yourself dodging every blow, countering every strike. You will find that the wind will lift you up, making you as free as a fallen autumn leaf. But heed, and do not lose yourself to the wind. Running is a viable option, though eventually you will find yourself with nowhere left to run to.\"\n\n-Will of Combat, Second Excerpt\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item's lore entry seems to refer to its function. Its reduction of firing rate will make fights generally take longer, but since the majority of survivors have at least one movement-related skill with a cooldown, the cooldown reduction will often make it easier to dodge attacks, and perhaps more notably, flee from unfavorable fights that may result from the player's reduced offensive capabilities. The last line of the lore seems to caution against relying on this hit-and-run style too much, as the limited size of each stage naturally means that the whole map could eventually fill up with all the enemies a player keeps running from.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Light Flux Pauldron",
