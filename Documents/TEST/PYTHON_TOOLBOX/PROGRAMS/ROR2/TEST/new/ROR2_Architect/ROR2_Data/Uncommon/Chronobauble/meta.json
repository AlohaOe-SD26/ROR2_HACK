    "notes": "The Chronobauble is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen the holder damages an enemy, that enemy is   slowed by 60% for 2 seconds (+2 seconds per stack). \n\n\n== Notes ==\nUnlike many other on-hit debuff effects, the Chronobauble is completely unaffected by the hit's proc coefficient. The slowness debuff will always have the same duration when inflicted, regardless of the attack.\nSince this item only affects movement speed and not attack speed, this item's benefits are negligible on enemies that use ranged attacks.\nThe slow effect can be used to keep close-range enemies such as   Imps at a distance, or to activate the  Death Mark.\nSome other close range enemies include   Blind Vermin and   Mithrix.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Chronobauble\n\nTracking Number: 99******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 03/03/2066\n\nShipping Method: Priority\n\nShipping Address: 9042 Pvt. Drive, Yustik Plaza, Mercury\n\nShipping Details:\n\nWeren't you just a kid? Summer break feels like it was just so recent - but it's been 10 years, hasn't it? Life moves faster and faster as you get older - less moments to remember, to cement you in time. I don't even remember being 25. How did I forget an entire year?\n\nAnyways - I found this in a trinket shop on Mercury. A chronobauble - the seller said something about special relativity, real heavy distortions or something - I didn't really get it. It's supposed to slow down time around it. Right.\n\nAnyways, I'm shipping this to myself - to arrive in 10 years. A gift, from me to me. A reminder to make memories, to slow down a bit. 10 years will pass so quick - try to remember them! You've got to put effort in life!\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nSlow Duration: 1 (+1 per stack) \u21d2 2 (+2 per stack)\nUpdate tier color outline to match other items",
