    "desc": "Killing an enemy surrounds you with an ice storm that deals 1200% damage per second and slows enemies by 80% for 1.5s . The storm grows with every kill , increasing its radius by 2m . Stacks up to 18m (+12m per stack) .",
    "notes": "The Frost Relic is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2.\nAs the holder kills enemies, an ice storm builds up in a sphere around them. The ice storm deals 300% damage every 0.25 seconds with a proc coefficient of 0.2, as well as   slowing all enemies hit. The radius of the storm starts at 8m and increases by 2m per kill, up to a maximum of 18m (+12m per stack). \n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Frost Relic cannot critically strike.\nThis item can usually be overlooked by most ranged classes, but it can be very useful to pick up as   Mercenary or   Loader. The radius is fairly small and is essentially a direct upgrade to melee DPS.\nPair the Frost Relic with  Focus Crystals to further increase its already high damage.\nDestroying clay pots and explosive barrels will build up the ice storm.\nThis can be a double-edged sword, as the ice storm will also destroy these objects. If players are not careful, they may end up taking heavy damage or dying.\nMany Frost Relic stacks might not be beneficial, as it is often impossible to kill enemies fast enough to benefit from them.\nThe  Forgive Me Please will charge the ice storm when active.\nThe Frost Relic is especially effective when the Artifact of Swarms is active, as there will be twice as many enemies to kill with only half the health.\nIf theArtifact of Chaos is enabled, the Frost Relic's ice storm will not hurt the holder.\nFrost Relic's zoom out can be misleading as   Railgunner while scoped in with   M99 Sniper or   HH44 Marksman, as the bullet fired will be fired from its original position. See the gallery for details.\nThis item can stay active while intangible using    Shadowfade ( Strides of Heresy).\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cSven Volz discovered the specimen that holds the record of Galaxy\u2019s Largest Snowflake: a whopping 0.5 meters in diameter, with an average temperature of -52 degrees. However \u2013 much to the despair of novelty snowflake enthusiasts everywhere \u2013 this gargantuan snowflake was lost in transit aboard the UES Contact Light, which disappeared in uncharted territory. One can only hope that it is preserved and frosty as ever, where ever it may be.\u201d\n\n- Academy Galactic Records 2056\n\n\n== Version History ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Frost Relic was an uncommon item in Risk of Rain 1.",
