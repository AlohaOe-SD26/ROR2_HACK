    "notes": "Safer Spaces is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of  Tougher Times.\nWhen the holder would take damage, if this item is charged, the damage is completely negated, displaying \"Blocked!\" instead of a damage number. After blocking damage, the item must recharge for 15 seconds (-10% per stack) before another hit can be negated.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nChoosing between Safer Spaces and Tougher Times can depend on what enemies you encounter during your run. Safer Spaces can be used for a guaranteed block against burst damage enemies like   Lunar Chimera (Golem),   Stone Golem, and   Mithrix. Tougher Times has no cooldown, allowing it to block multiple hits from enemies that attack rapidly, such as   Clay Templar and   Lunar Chimera (Wisp).\nStacking Safer Spaces or Tougher Times will allow for more frequent blocks. It's possible to reduce Safer Spaces cooldown to 1 frame (0.0167 seconds) with 65 stacks, effectively granting the user immunity to attacks. However, reaching 100% block chance with Tougher Times is impossible; the maximum is 99.9%. 65 stacks of Tougher Times will instead give 90.7% block chance.\nThe   Safer Spaces Ready status effect above the health bar will indicate whether it is charged or not, and a circular shield appears around the Survivor. The effect changes to   Safer Spaces Cooldown while it is recharging, but unlike   Elemental Rings Cooldown and   Singularity Band Cooldown, the recharge period is not indicated with multiple stacks.\nSafer Spaces cannot block damage inflicted by the   Void Fog debuff.\nIt can, however, block damage inflicted by opening a Void Cradle.\nIf this item is on cooldown when the   Mithrix steals it, it will grant instant cooldown restoration on every frame when it is given back, making the player virtually immune to damage for the rest of the stage. This bug can also be triggered by  Wake of Vultures and killing a Voidtouched enemy (more details and a technical explanation can be found in that item's page).\nKeep in mind that upon defeating the third phase, it takes 6 seconds before Mithrix starts stealing items and he does so every 0.21666666 seconds. For 9 stacks of more of this item, the shield cooldown will always expire before Mithrix has a chance to steal it. For fewer stacks, it depends on how many items he has to steal before he steals this.\n  REX can trigger the cooldown on demand with any of its skills that cost HP, which can be timed right before the item is stolen, bypassing any stack requirements.\nThe same applies for   Void Fiend's Void Corruption.\nAny survivor can trigger the cooldown on demand by intentionally taking damage from any lingering sources of damage, i.e., the   Lunar Chimera's (Exploder) blasing pools, and the blue flame pillars created by phase 3 Mithrix.\nTaking fall damage can be relied upon, but the player must be near the ramps at the edge of the arena before killing the third phase in anticipation of this. Having items or equipment that give enough height boost is another alternative. However, playing as   Loader or holding  H3AD-5T v2 makes the player immune to fall damage, making this not a viable method.\nEquipment and skills that can hit the player, i.e.,  Helfire Tincture,  Glowing Meteorite, and   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike can also be used. Note that Diablo Strike may require precise planning if timing is of the essence.\nWith the Artifact of Chaos survivors can harm themselves. Some allied monsters will also return friendly fire upon being hit, but the player should be mindful they will remain aggressive and pose complications for the last phase of the boss.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nActivating the  Blast Shower recharges Safer Spaces immediately.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe charge cooldown is determined by the formula f(x)=15\u22190.9x, with x being the amount of Safer Spaces.\n\nVoidtouched enemies gain the shield recharge behavior without any item stacks, therefore their cooldown is 15 seconds.\nThe minimum cooldown is 1 frame (0.0167 seconds), achieved with at least 65 stacks of Safer Spaces.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"You can't shoot me.\n\nYou can't taze me.\n\nYou can't gas me.\n\nYou can't even knock me down.\n\nNot without something very precious going squish.\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Safer Spaces\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item appears to be a tardigrade, a microscopic animal sometimes known as a \"water bear\". Tardigrades are known for their incredible survivability and resilience, being found in locations that would kill almost any other animal.\nThe name \"Safer Spaces\" is a reversal of Tougher Times, as \"safe\" can be thought of as an opposite of \"tough\" and space is the opposite of time, as well as both names being alliterations.\nWhen a hit is blocked, a deeper version of the squeaky toy sound effect that Tougher Times uses is played.\nThe lore quote is a direct reference to the comic Insufferable issue #6, where it is spoken by a character who is wearing makeshift armor made from multiple babies taped onto his clothing.",
