    "notes": "The Milky Chrysalis is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen activated, the player gets the ability to fly for 15 seconds. \nThe direction of flight is directly dependent on where the Chrysalis is displayed on the body and jumping allows the player to dash in the direction of movement with no cooldown. Moving vertically is relative to the direction they are facing while moving forwards or backwards. Once the buff expires, the player will float back to the ground if they were in the air. \n\n\n== Tips ==\nUsing the Chrysalis, the player can skip the pillar charging sequence on Commencement and fly straight to the arena.\nIf the player does not have enough movement speed items like  Paul's Goat Hoof, or enough equipment cooldown items like the  Fuel Cell, they will need to rest on one of the support beams below the arena.\nThis equipment can assist low-mobility survivors like   Engineer and   Captain, which can open up previously unreachable areas that were hard or impossible to reach naturally.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Milky Chrysalis\n\nTracking Number: 393*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 11/27/2056\n\nShipping Method: High Priority/Biological\n\nShipping Address: Diptera Research Center, Io\n\nShipping Details:\n\nDeep within the plague wastes there is an alcove free from disease. It is home to a group of insects that have NOT acclimated to their environment. They survive not through resistance\u2026 but through transformation. \n\nI\u2019ve witnessed the creatures undergoing infinite states of metamorphosis. Each change that happens to them is reflected in the surrounding land. This constantly molds the area into something less toxic.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine that they don\u2019t have an upper limit - a final form. What adjustments would that final form bring? Are there any restrictions to what can be modified? I\u2019m sending this sample to you to study. Please be careful with it, as it\u2019s frozen in a cryo cell mid-transformation.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUnknown\n(Undocumented) Removed Bug Wings buff and +20% movement speed bonus\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nBug Fixes\nFixed Milky Chrysalis not working on characters without the display (i.e   Heretic)\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix Milky Chrysalis flight not being refreshed if used while in exhaustion descent\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Milky Chrysalis\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nNow grants true flight and antigravity instead of jump-to-hover.\nPressing jump now performs a short dash in the direction of movement with a 0.5s cooldown.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nDue to the direction of flight being dependent on the position of the wings on the character, using characters that do not have display rules defined prevents the Chrysalis from being used entirely. This is mostly encountered when using Survivor Mods.\nSometimes, if the player activates a Milky Chrysalis while the Artifact of Enigma is active (obtained via Artifact of Sacrifice or an Equipment Barrel, as Milky Chrysalis cannot be obtained from the Artifact of Enigma), it will grant infinite flight for the rest of the stage. This behavior may be patched in the future updates.",
