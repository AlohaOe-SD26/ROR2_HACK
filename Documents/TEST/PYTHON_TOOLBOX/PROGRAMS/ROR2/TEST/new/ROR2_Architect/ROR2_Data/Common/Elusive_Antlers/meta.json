    "notes": "Elusive Antlers is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nThe item increases spawns 1-3 energy orbs every 10 seconds (-10% duration per stack). Energy orbs, when picked up, grant a 12% movement speed increase which can be stacked 3 times (+3 per stack) and lasts for 12 seconds.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nEnergy orbs appear a short distance away in the direction that the holder is currently facing. Energy orbs will always appear on the ground, even if the holder is looking up.\nStacking the energy orb buff resets the buff's 12 second duration and further increases movement speed by 12% for each stack. Once 12 seconds pass without picking up another orb, all stacks of the buff are immediately removed.\nThe orbs have a minimum spawn time of 2 seconds, and cannot be lower than that.\nEnergy orbs from this item are a very consistent and easy way to help keep the stat buff from  Collector's Compulsion active for as long as possible.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Questionable Antlers\nEstimated Delivery: 01/20/2057\nShipping method: Standard\nShipping Address: Locker #02, Merchant's Guild, Mercury\nShipping details:\n\nLet\u2019s wrap this up, the General is not a patient man.\nI\u2019m shipping your order to the locker you specified.\n\nI expect full payment, or I\u2019ll hire some Grey Guilders to count the gold straight from your pocket.\n\nBefore the General hunted a bigger set for himself, this pair was \u2026favored\u2026 in the field. Only put these under a microscope if you want trouble sleeping.\n\nI\u2019ve tried many hemo-scrubs but whatever makes these so sturdy also made it impossible to clean entirely. I\u2019ve attached some nano tech (not cheap!) to the device to let it through the UES bio-scanners. The rest is up to you.\n\n-R\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.8\nNow will spawn more orbs per stack (+1 per stack -> +3 per stack) and has had its minimum spawn time for orbs reduced from 5 seconds to 2 seconds.\nUpdate Notes V1.3.7\nThe base speed benefit of Elusive Antlers has been removed. You can now only gain speed by collecting the orb drops.\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nAntler Shield - Renamed to Elusive Antlers\nOld Functionality - 55% (+5% per stack) chance on being hit to reflect 10% (+10% per stack) damage back to the attacker.\nNew Functionality - Increases movement speed by 7% (+7% per stack). Spawns orbs of energy nearby every 10 seconds (-10% per stack) giving +12% movement speed up to 3 times (+1 per stack) for 12 seconds.\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nAntler Shield",
