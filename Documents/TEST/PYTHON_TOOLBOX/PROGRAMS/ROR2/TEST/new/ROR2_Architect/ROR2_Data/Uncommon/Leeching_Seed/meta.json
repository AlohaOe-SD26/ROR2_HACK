    "notes": "The Leeching Seed is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2.\nUpon damaging an enemy, the holder recovers 1 (+1 per stack) health, multiplied by the proc coefficient of the hit. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nVisuals for damage and healing numbers are rounded up, so the Leeching Seed's healing may appear as 1 per hit when in fact it may be lower.\nCorrection: Healing is only applied on hit, not on damage.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nShotgun attacks such as   Bandit's   Burst and   Captain's   Vulcan Shotgun work well with Leeching Seeds, since each attack fires many individual hits.\nOn the other hand, Survivors with relatively low attack speed or hit count, such as   Loader, will struggle to make good use of this item.\nThis item becomes generally outclassed by the  Harvester's Scythe once the player has enough critical strike chance.\nThe hit requirement makes it unsuitable for Damage over Time effects such as poison or bleed.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nIt was a crisp evening - and things were looking up. The botanist began walking towards the Plant Biology Complex to check on several alien plants that had been recovered from the week before.\n\nAnother worker was already in the complex, busy at work.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d \u201cOh, hello!\u201d The worker greeted her enthusiastically. He was carrying several bags of fertilizer, and she gave him a quizzical look. \u201cYou need any help with those?\u201d She said, gathering her clipboard for her check.\n\n\u201cOh no, I\u2019m alright. It\u2019s a good workout, actually,\u201d he said. As they walked, the botanist couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of job would require THAT much fertilizer.\n\nAs the door to the greenhouse whirred open, she got her answer \u2013 roots scaling the height of the greenhouse and snaking along the ceiling, even invading the containers of other specimens. \u201cWhat the hell!?\u201d She cried, her jaw slack. And then she noticed the other plants. \n\nEvery other plant in the greenhouse had withered \u2013 with an incriminating root leading back to the overgrowth that the worker was now feeding fertilizer. The botanist was speechless. \u201cWhat happened...? What... what is that...?\u201d She stammered. The worker turned to her and grinned.\n\n\u201cOne of the species we got in the last expedition. He demands a lot of nutrients - it took me so long to get him to even sprout. I was wracking my brain, trying every trick in the book. And every other specimen seemed to be growing fine, so I figured, hey, why not share some of that? And look!\u201d\n\nSpreading his arms, the worker marveled at the gallery of dead plants. Dropping her clipboard, the botanist\u2019s stomach sank. Things were no longer looking up.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Leeching Seed\nQuality of Life\nUpdate visuals to match other assets\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item is based on the real world Broomrape plant, which is parasitic.",
