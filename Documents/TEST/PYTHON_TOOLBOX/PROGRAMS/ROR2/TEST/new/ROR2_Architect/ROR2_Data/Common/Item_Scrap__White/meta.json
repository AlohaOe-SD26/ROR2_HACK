    "notes": "Item Scrap is a group of items in Risk of Rain 2 with no passive effects. However, when using a 3D Printer or Cauldron, any Item Scrap of the required rarity will be prioritized and consumed before any other item. \nThese items cannot be found normally. Instead, using a Scrapper to get rid of an item or a Drone Scrapper to get rid of a Drone will produce an Item Scrap of the same rarity:\n\nWhite (Common) items and drones produce  Item Scrap, White\nGreen (Uncommon) items and drones produce  Item Scrap, Green\nRed (Legendary) items and drones produce  Item Scrap, Red\nYellow (Boss) items produce  Item Scrap, Yellow\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe  Recycler cannot be used on these items, and they do not appear in Scrappers.\nIf the player uses a Shrine of Order while holding Item Scrap, it is possible for all their items of the same rarity as that Item Scrap to be transformed into Item Scrap.\nIf upgraded using  Benthic Bloom, it may transform into any item of the target rarity, unrestricted by category.\nDespite working similarly to 3D Printers, no Item Scrap equivalent exists for use in Cleansing Pools.\nIf Artifact of Devotion is enabled, when a Lemurian follower is killed, it will drop one Scrap in the same tier as the item that was offered to hatch it.\nItem Scraps  White,  Green, and  Red can be obtained through the Drone Scrapper.\nItem Scraps can be duplicated via Crafting.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nAll scrap have the same lore entry.\n\n\u201cWhile officially licensed materials are always recommended, hobbyists are known to take matters into their own hands when in a pinch. Don\u2019t have any materials up to par? Make your own! Recycling old parts can be a fun way to create materials for your projects.\u201d\n\n- The Ultimate Hobby Guide: Kitbashing and 3D Printing\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Item Scrap\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix scrap interaction with cauldrons\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New item: Item Scrap ( White,  Green,  Red,  Yellow)",
