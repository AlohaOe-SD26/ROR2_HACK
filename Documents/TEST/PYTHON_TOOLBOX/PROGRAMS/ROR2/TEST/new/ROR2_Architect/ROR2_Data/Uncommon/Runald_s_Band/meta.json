    "notes": "Runald's Band is an item in Risk of Rain 2. Its counterpart is  Kjaro's Band, and they are both unlocked and start appearing in runs after completing the Death Do Us Part Challenge.\nWhen striking an enemy with an attack that deals 400% or more damage, the Band creates an icy explosion that deals 250% (+250% per stack) total damage to that enemy and   greatly slows it for 3 seconds (+3 seconds per stack). This bonus attack has a cooldown of 10 seconds and a proc coefficient of 0.0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nIn addition to dealing at least 400% damage, a hit must have a proc coefficient greater than 0.0 to activate the Bands. Damage bonuses such as critical strikes or  Armor-Piercing Rounds will not cause weaker hits to activate the Bands, even if the final damage dealt is above 400% base damage.\n  Mercenary's signature   Expose debuff is an exception. When Mercenary hits an Exposed enemy, the hit deals an extra 350% damage, which does count towards the Bands' activation.\nThis item always activates simultaneously with Kjaro's Band.\nThe cooldown for the Bands can be seen above the player's health bar as a   status effect with up to 10 stacks. 1 stack is removed every second, and when the last stack is removed the Bands are   ready and can be activated again.\nBecause this status effect is considered a debuff, activating the  Blast Shower will reset the cooldown immediately.\nDespite the triggering hit and Runald's Band proc occurring simultaneously, the bonus damage from  Crowbar will only apply to the proc if they remain over 90% health after the triggering hit.\nDespite firing a \"runic ice blast\", it does not freeze enemies. Instead it applies an 80% slow to them.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Should memories be lost,\n\nShould oceans be clouded,\n\nWill you bring me fervor?\n\nWill you die with me?\"\n\n-The Syzygy of Io and Europa\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nRunald\u2019s/Kjaro\u2019s Band  Developer Notes: The two rings have undergone a bit of a rework, working off of an internal cooldown rather than a chance on-hit. We\u2019re hoping that this can help diversify one of our \u201con-hit\u201d items to be more than just attacking enemies and hoping things activate. We\u2019ve also changed the behavior of Kjaro\u2019s to be more of the AoE option, while Runald\u2019s is the single target option.\nProc Chance: 8% \u21d2 100%\nNow has an internal cooldown of 10 seconds\nNow has a minimum threshold of only triggering on attacks that deal 400% or greater damage\nIce Blast Damage: 250% (+125% per stack) \u21d2 250% (+250% per stack)\nIce Debuff Duration: 3s \u21d2 3s (+3s per stack)\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nDamage: 250% (+125% per stack) additive damage \u21d2 250% (+125% per stack) total damage\nEarly Access Release\nIntroduced as \"8% chance on hit to strike an enemy with a runic ice blast, slowing them by 80% and dealing 250% additive damage (+125% per stack).\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIt is implied that this item was used as a wedding ring for a pair of   Elder Lemurians.",
