    "notes": "The Hardlight Afterburner is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nThe holder gains an extra 2 (+2 per stack) charges of their utility skill, and the cooldown of their utility skill is reduced by 33%.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Engineer's   Bubble Shield can be maintained 100% of the time with the Afterburner's cooldown reduction.\n  Mercenary and   REX can stay in the air indefinitely using their utility skills when holding an Afterburner.\n  Huntress can do the same with   Blink.\nWhen paired with the  Strides of Heresy, the Hardlight Afterburner makes using   Shadowfade much easier. With 3 charges, the player can gain up to 9 seconds of invulnerability at a time, depending on how much invulnerable time the situation calls for.\n  Captain thrives with this item, as both of his utility abilities are very powerful damage abilities. With a Hardlight Afterburner, Captain can use up to 9   Orbital Probes or 3   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strikes in quick succession, allowing him to concentrate damage on a single target or spread damage across a much wider area.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Specimen XAS4-49\n\nTracking Number: 342******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 12/29/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Priority\n\nShipping Address: Geshka Tower, 33 Floor, Mars\n\nShipping Details:\n\nOur 'hard light' research has become even more refined since our last correspondence. \n\nThe initial purpose of the afterburner was to function as a primary heatsink for our bigger HL implementations - like our bridges and barriers. However, if attached to a rapidly degrading source, like those we typically dispose, we get a wonderful emission rate of semi-tachyonic particles. In other words... extremely high capacity fueling.\n\nIt should be obvious by its design, but to reiterate: stay away from the HL exhaust end when active. The emission method is violent by design, and so should be mounted to static, STABLE sources only.",
