    "notes": "Unstable Transmitter is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nThe item grants the   Dimensional Aura buff. Upon falling below 25% health, the item's holder receives 60% of their maximum health as barrier and gains a small spherical aura that teleports and   bleeds enemies that enter it. The aura lasts for 8 seconds, but enemies killed by the aura increase its duration by 1 second each. When the effect ends, the item is consumed, and it regenerates at the beginning of each stage.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe buffs duration cannot exceed 10s from killing enemies.\nItems that are consumed at low health, such as  Delicate Watch and  Power Elixir, will not be consumed when the Unstable Transmitter's effect is triggered.\nTeleporting enemies inflicts them with 3 stacks of   Bleed.\nThe item has a 1.1 second internal cooldown, so multiple can not be used in quick succession.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"You touch it.\n\"No way, you touch it.\"\n\n-Signal echoes, UES Safe Travels\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.8\nUnstable Transmitter now grants 60% barrier on activation (up from 35%). It has also had its internal cooldown changed from 45 seconds to 1.1 seconds, for those of you that choose to hoard several Transmitters at a time.\nUpdate Notes V1.3.7\nUnstable Transmitter can now only be activated once per stage and barrier gain has been reduced to 35% of maximum health (was 75%.) Item regenerates at the start of each stage. One Shot Protection removed.\nCorrection: The items holder now gains 50% of their maximum health as barrier, not 35%.\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nUnstable Transmitter\nOld Functionality - When reaching below 25% health the Survivor explodes, dealing 350% (+350% per item stack) damage to nearby enemies and teleporting to a random location. This effect has a cooldown of 2 minutes (-5% per item stack).\nUpdated Functionality - Falling below 25% health gives you 75% of your maximum health as a temporary barrier. Gain a dimensional aura for 8s that bleeds and teleports away enemies. Enemies killed by the aura extend the duration by 1s. Recharges every 45s (-10% per stack.)\nBlacklisted  Unstable Transmitter,  Breaching Fin and  Sonorous Whispers from situations where enemies can obtain items (such as Simulacrum.)\nSeekers of the Storm\nAdded 18 Pickups\nUnstable Transmitter",
