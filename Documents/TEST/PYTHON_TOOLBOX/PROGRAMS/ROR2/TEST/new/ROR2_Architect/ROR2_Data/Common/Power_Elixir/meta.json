    "notes": "The Power Elixir is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nWhen the holder takes damage that brings them below 25% of their maximum health, this item is consumed and they are healed for 75% of their maximum health. This effect will only consume a single stack of this item. Consumed Power Elixirs are transformed into  Empty Bottles, which do nothing and can not be scrapped.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nWhile the player is holding this item, a faint black line will appear over the health bar at the 25% mark, signifying when this item's effect will trigger.\nPaying the second or third offering at a Shrine of Blood will immediately consume a Power Elixir.\nIf the player falls below 25% health with their   healing disabled from a   Malachite Elite, all Power Elixirs are consumed at once. No health is recovered, since healing is impossible, so all the Power Elixirs are wasted.\nThis scenario is more likely to occur than it seems, when considering that Malachite Elites deal 6 times as much damage as a non-Elite monster.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nIf the player falls below 25% health while holding both a Power Elixir and a  Delicate Watch, the Power Elixir triggers first, healing the player and preventing the watch from breaking.\n  Engineer's turrets can hold out longer against a overwhelming surge of enemies, as long as Engineer himself has some unspent Power Elixirs. Anytime a turret gets low on health, it will consume its own Power Elixirs and stay in the fight for a little while longer.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: 16 oz. Flask, Healing Potion (Not my Strongest)\n\nTracking Number: 10******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 12/31/2058\n\nShipping Method: Priority\n\nShipping Address: Cargo Bay 10-C, Terminal 504-B, UES Port Trailing Comet\nShipping Details: \n- Re: Potion seller, I am going into battle. I require your strongest potions.\n\nMy potions are too strong for you, buyer. I've instead downgraded you to a weaker brew. My strongest potions would kill a dragon, let alone a man!\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Power Elixir\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item was originally revealed as simply \"Elixir.\"\nThe Power Elixir's logbook entry heavily references Justin Kuritzkes's Potion Seller video short, in which a self-conscious knight repeatedly attempts to buy potions from an extravagantly dismissive potion seller. The \"(Not my Strongest)\" included in the order's title, and practically the entire \"Shipping Details\" section, consist of lines directly quoted or paraphrased from the original video.\nThis item is a reference to the Power Elixir item from Maplestory.",
