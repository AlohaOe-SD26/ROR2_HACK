    "notes": "The Bison Steak is an item introduced in the Hidden Realms Update.\nThe item grants the player a flat +25 maximum HP (+25 HP per stack).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item gets extra value out of health-increasing items such as  Transcendence,  Stone Flux Pauldron,  Spinel Tonic,  Pearl and  Irradiant Pearl. For instance, one Transcendence will allow the Bison Steak to provide a flat +37.5 maximum health instead of the usual +25.\nConversely, any reduction to maximum health (like from  Shaped Glass or  Tonic Affliction) will lessen the value of this item. One Shaped Glass will bring the health bonus down from +25 to a mere +12.5.\nWith Artifact of Glass this item only grants 10% (2.5 HP) per stack.\nThis item provides Growth when used on   False Son.\nIf used in the Wandering CHEF, this item can be upgraded into  Seared Steak if combined with a  Mocha,  Eclipse Lite,  Power Elixir,  Energy Drink,  Bustling Fungus,  Cautious Slug,  Monster Tooth, or another  Bison Steak. This will double the flat health increase and add a small percentage increase to max health as well.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Assorted Saturnian Bison Steak, 10lbs\n\nTracking Number: 31***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 11/02/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Standard\n\nShipping Address: Sloppy Joe\u2019s Deli and Catering, Manhattan, New York\n\nShipping Details: \n\nFOR: JOSEPH ******\n\nCC#: **** **** * ***\n\nACCT#: 102215\n\nQuality Saturnian Bison Meat [10lbs]\n\nTreated with special antibiotics to ensure exceptional growth, shelf life, and texture.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Bison Steak\nGameplay Changes\nReplaced 'Fresh Meat' item\nNo longer grants regeneration on kill\nNow grants 25 (+25 per stack) max health\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item: Fresh Meat\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nWhen Fresh Meat was first added, it increased base health regeneration by +2 hp/s for 3s (+3s per stack) after killing an enemy.\nThe effect of the Fresh Meat that the Bison Steak replaced is similar to the Meat Nugget from Risk of Rain 1, which has a chance to drop healing meat nuggets when damaging an enemy.",
