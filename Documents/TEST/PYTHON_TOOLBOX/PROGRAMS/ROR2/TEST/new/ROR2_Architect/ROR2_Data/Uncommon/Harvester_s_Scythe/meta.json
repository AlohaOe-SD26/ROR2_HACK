    "notes": "The Harvester's Scythe is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Prismatically Aligned Challenge.\nWhen landing a critical strike, the holder heals a flat 8 (+4 per stack) health, multiplied by the proc coefficient of the attack.  \nAdditionally, the first Scythe a player obtains grants +5% critical strike chance. Stacking more Scythes will not increase critical strike chance further. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe visuals for healing are always rounded up, but this does not reflect the actual healing gained.\nWith no other sources of critical strike chance, the Scythe provides an average of 0.48 healing per hit. With a single  Lens-Maker's Glasses, this is increased to 1.28 healing per hit.\nThis is on average better than the  Leeching Seed, although inconsistent. Gaining more critical strike chance makes the Scythe's healing more reliable and effective than the Leeching Seed.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAny way to guarantee critical strikes makes this item considerably stronger, even at low stacks.   Bandit and   Railgunner can land guaranteed critical strikes with their   Backstab and Weak Point mechanics, respectively, and any Survivor can get guaranteed critical chance for a short period with the  Ocular HUD.\nWhen not playing as the above Survivors and without the Ocular HUD, it might be worth avoiding the  Lost Seer's Lenses if relying on the Harvester's Scythe for healing, as losing all  Lens-Maker's Glasses dramatically lowers this item's effectiveness.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cI\u2019m not going nowhere. What I do is important, and no plague is going to stop me from getting that done. City folk are all up in a tizzy over this and that, scared that ya\u2019ll will pass without doing some crazy goals you set for yourself. \n\nBut me, I\u2019m not afraid of death. Suffering is just another part of life, and like labor, I can do it myself. To death, I say: I don\u2019t need your damn help.\u201d\n\n- Unnamed Farmer, Tragedy of Mercury: A History\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Harvester's Scythe",
