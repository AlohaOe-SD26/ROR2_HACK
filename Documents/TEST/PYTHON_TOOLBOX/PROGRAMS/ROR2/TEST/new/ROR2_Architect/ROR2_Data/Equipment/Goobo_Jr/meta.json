    "notes": "Goobo Jr. is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nWhen activated, the holder launches a dark blob projectile, which spawns a gummy clone of the holder at the site of impact. This clone's base damage and maximum health are both 300% of the player's. After 30 seconds, the clone will instantly die regardless of its current health, regardless of the healing effects from healing items such as  Bustling Fungus and/or  Gnarled Woodsprite.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nGummy clones have the exact same skill loadout as the player who spawned it, and they do not inherit the player's items.\nIf Goobo Jr. is given to an   Equipment Drone, it will produce a gummy clone of the Equipment Drone, not the player.\nGummy clones of   MUL-T,   REX,   CHEF, and   Engineer's turrets are considered mechanical, which means they benefit from  Spare Drone Parts and are immune to   Void Infestors.\nNon-mechanical gummy clones can be corrupted by Void Infestors.\nA maximum of 3 gummy clones can be spawned by the holder who spawned them.\nThis limit can be bypassed to have multiple gummy clones out at once by spawning a ghost of them with  Happiest Mask, however they will still die after 30 seconds regardless.\nThe icon in the ally cards (which normally shows their character icon) for the gummy clone is replaced with the icon for the equipment.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nA gummy   Engineer will also place gummy turrets, allowing up to 4 turrets per Engineer player (or 5 if the player has at least one  Lysate Cell). However, since gummy Engineer has no items, its turrets will not have any either.\nGummy turrets die after 30 seconds of being spawned. However, their death is independent of the gummy Engineer's death.\nA gummy   Railgunner will aggressively and accurately used charged shots, can fire two in its lifetime, and can crit if the weak point happens to be where the clone tries to aim. This on top of the damage bonus clones receive means that Railgunner clones will always be somewhat effective in combat, at least in the first loop.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"I'm telling you, you need to be more strict with your little slime project, dude. I caught him rummaging through my stuff earlier. You know how hard it is to get stains out of these UES uniforms? \"\n\n\"His NAME is Goobo Jr., thank you very much. And I'm sure he was just playing. He likes his uncle Rich, isn't that right, Goobo?\"\n\n\"It doesn't have vocal chords, Mike.\"\n\n\"You don't have vocal chords.\"\n\n\"Real mature. Anyway, you better stop messing around, or the Captain will send that slime ball to the front lines. Now, I got to go do my job. Y'know, what we were sent here for, not playing dollhouse with your \u2018science project' over here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah... Alright, he's gone. Hey Goobo, listen up. You got a good look at Rich, right? I got an idea to knock him down a few notches. First, you gotta take on his shape, and then...\"\n\n[THIS LOG HAS BEEN FLAGGED FOR REVIEW AS PART OF: COURT MARTIAL OF RICHARD D.
