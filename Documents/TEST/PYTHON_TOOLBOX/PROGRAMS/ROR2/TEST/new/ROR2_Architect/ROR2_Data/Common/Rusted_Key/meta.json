    "desc": "A hidden cache containing an item ( 80% / 20% ) will appear in a random location on each stage . Opening the cache consumes this item.",
    "notes": "The Rusted Key is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Keyed Up Challenge.\nEach stage, a Rusty Lockbox spawns for each player holding a Rusted Key. The lockbox's contents are the same as a Large Chest, with an 80% chance to contain an uncommon item and a 20% chance to contain a legendary item. One key is consumed upon opening a lockbox.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nRusty Lockboxes will spawn even if the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled.\nLockboxes will only start spawning the stage after the player picks up the key; it does not modify the current stage when obtained.\nThe quantity of lockboxes per stage is only related to the number of players that have keys; the number of keys held by each individual player does not matter.\nFor this reason, players who have more keys than the rest should try to unlock lockboxes for other players, so that each player can still hold onto at least 1 key to spawn as many lockboxes as possible.\nTemporary Rusted Keys are prioritized over permanent Rusted Keys when opening Rusty Lockboxes.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Key\n\nTracking Number: 12******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 01/21/2056\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: |||||||, Druid Hills, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nI don't trust UESC. Not one bit. Their Security Chests? Full of overrides and backdoors- I've got a cousin working in their factory, and they've got all kinds of weird things going on in those chests. I've seen so many of them in auctions - for the lost and unclaimed ones - and you just pay money, and it springs open on the spot. Are you kidding me?\n\nAnyways, I'm sending you exactly what I said I would - but it's too important to leave the security up to the UESC. So I'm sending the key to you - and the lockbox to Margaret. Like a two-factor authentication. Let me know when you get this.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nBug Fixes\nFixed stray nodes causing lockboxes to spawn midair on the   final stage\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Now subtly glows and pulses\nNow grants items at the same rarity as a Large Chest\nNow spawns a Lockbox per player with a Rusted Key\nNow consumes a Rusted Key when a lockbox is opened, and requires a Rusted Key to open\nNo longer scales reward chance with the number of Keys in your inventory  Developer Notes: People have always been a bit confused about the behavior of the Rusted Key, so we made it make a bit more sense by actually consuming a key to open. 1 Key = 1 Box. Since the item no longer gives \u2018infinite\u2019 items, we can also make it a bit stronger and make the lockbox more noticeable.\nQuality of Life\nUpdate visuals to match other assets\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nIncrease lockbox size by 50% and make slightly shinier",
