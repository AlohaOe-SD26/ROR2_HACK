    "notes": "The Executive Card is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void update.\nWhenever the holder makes a purchase with gold, 10% of the gold spent on that purchase (rounded down) is returned to the holder after a moment. This effect has a 0.1 second cooldown. In addition, when the holder purchases from a Multishop Terminal, Equipment Triple Shop, Triple Drone Shop, or the shop dropped by the  Shipping Request Form, the other terminals will not close and will instead remain open for purchase, allowing the cardholder to get all the items from the Multishop.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nUnlike most other equipment, this item cannot be activated manually; instead, its activation is triggered when purchasing something with gold. This matters for the  War Horn and  Bottled Chaos, which will trigger whenever a purchase is made.\nDue to how equipment cooldowns work, the cash-back effect will not work if the Executive Card is picked up while there is a current equipment cooldown from the previously-held equipment. If the holder makes a purchase while the Executive Card is still on cooldown, Multishop Terminals and their variants will close after making a purchase, and they will not get 10% back on the purchase.\nEquipment charges provided by  Fuel Cells can be used to mitigate this effect, but charges will only be replenished when the cooldown finishes regardless.\nNote that with the Executive Card's cooldown being 0.1 seconds if the player is repeatedly pressing the Interact Key in front of a multishop, it is possible to purchase the second item while the equipment is on cooldown and lose out on the third terminal. Therefore, it is advised to hold down the Interact Key instead, as the frequency with which it registers as pressed will avoid this issue.\nIf held by   MUL-T while using   Retool, the Executive Card will not function if it is not in MUL-T's active equipment slot.\nThe  Functional Coupler functions the same: if the Executive Card is not the currently active equipment, the user will not benefit from it.\n  Captain's   Hacking Beacons will inherit the equipment's passive effect when he holds it and they will be able to hack and buy all three items of Multishop Terminals for free with a single beacon.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThough it denies the use of more powerful active equipment, this item can drastically increase the amount of items picked up from a stage. The holder is also still free to swap out the Executive Card for a different equipment later in the run, once they are satisfied with their extra items.\nThis is especially useful on the fourth and fifth stage environments (  Abyssal Depths,   Siren's Call,   Sundered Grove, and   Sky Meadow) because Multishop Terminals on those stages are guaranteed to contain Uncommon items.\nIf the player is holding an Executive Card while the previous equipment is on cooldown, upon the cooldown expiring all the equipment charges will be effectively refreshed as any remaining cooldowns will use the Executive Card's, which is negligible.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"When you're on the planet, keep a look out for any loose UES Security Chests.
