This burst potential is easier to obtain than reducing skill cooldowns to the minimum of 0.5 seconds through  Purity or  Brainstalks, although cooldown reduction is still effective for reloading the charges.\nThis item affects   MUL-T's secondary fire when in   Power Mode, although it can only be utilized by   Scrap Launcher.\nHowever, upon exiting Power Mode, all charges of   Blast Canister granted by Backup Magazines will be refreshed, turning the ability from largely a stun utility to a genuine source of damage with enough charges. Alternating between activating the skill and entering sprint to reset the animation will launch Blast Canisters more quickly.\nThis item lets   Railgunner fire additional consecutive shots while scoped in with   M99 Sniper before having to reload. However, with   HH44 Marksman, this item is functionally useless.\nThe   final boss utilizes Backup Magazines during Phase 4, which can work to the player's favor, as the self-damaging Lunar Orbs ability resides in his secondary slot; repeated uses will quickly reduce his health and return the player's items.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Ammo Magazine, Standard Ammunition (45mm Rounds)\n\nTracking Number: 05***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 10/05/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Priority\n\nShipping Address: Cargo Bay 10-C, Terminal 504-B, UES Port Trailing Comet\n\nShipping Details: \n\n- Billed to: Captain [REDACTED]\n\n- Note from Sender:  You going on a hunting trip or something?

If the rocket still has not hit anything after 16 seconds, it automatically explodes.\nCritical chance is rolled upon activation. If the chance succeeds, all fireworks from that instance will deal critical damage.\nThe Bundle of Fireworks becomes substantially less useful with the Artifact of Sacrifice, since no Chests spawn.\nThis item cannot be obtained in the Simulacrum mode, and will appear locked if attempting to select it with the Artifact of Command.\nFireworks are affected by the  Pocket I.C.B.M.. Instead of launching 3 times as many rockets over a longer period, 3 rockets are launched at once every 0.1 seconds instead of the normal 1.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe vending machine spawned by  Remote Caffeinator allows for easy, repeated use of the Bundle of Fireworks and  Squid Polyp while in boss arenas or other areas which do not typically have interactables.\nOwing to its low proc coefficient, this item cannot reliably activate chance-based on-hit items like  Tri-Tip Dagger and  AtG Missile Mk. 1. To make the most out of this item, consider damage-increasing items that ignore proc coefficients entirely; these include  Lens-Maker's Glasses,  Delicate Watch,  Crowbar,  Armor-Piercing Rounds and  Brilliant Behemoth.\nSpecial mention goes to the  Plasma Shrimp, not only for its ability to ignore proc coefficients entirely, but also for being affected by the  Pocket I.C.B.M. as well. The amount of fireworks will be tripled, and each firework will proc three missiles on hit, leading to exponential damage returns.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Hey, happy anniversary!\n\nYou really thought I forgot?\n\nAh, I thought I was the dumb one in our relationship.

It also can affect minions, such as drones,   Aurelionite,  Squid Turrets, and even ghosts from the  Happiest Mask. As a result, it can keep multiple turrets or ghosts alive despite their constant health drain and keep nearby minions healthy.\nHaving 177 Bustling Fungus will reach more than 100% healing (100.125%) per tick, which is effectively a soft cap without items using overhealing such as  Aegis. The  Rejuvenation Rack will greatly reduce the number needed to hit this cap (87 with only one Rack).\nThe effective healing radius is visible as a bright green circle around the holder, and green mushrooms of various sizes growing and disappearing. Any entity receiving healing inside the radius is also outlined in green.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Bustling Fungus is extremely powerful to stack as   Engineer (with his   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets), due to his turrets' ability to inherit his item inventory and their immobility. Each turret will automatically create a healing radius, sustaining not just itself but Engineer as well.\nThis strategy is particularly effective when combined with Engineer's   Bubble Shield.\n N'kuhana's Opinion is extremely powerful with this item, especially with the aforementioned Engineer strategy.\n  MUL-T can make excellent use of the Fungus while in   Power Mode, since the player's movement speed is already drastically reduced.\nThe bonus healing also further augments MUL-T's survivability, on top of the large armor bonus from Power Mode.\n  REX can rapidly fire   Seed Barrage while remaining stationary using the Fungus, quickly regaining the health lost from using the skill.\nThe Fungus's healing can easily offset the burning damage from the  Helfire Tincture, especially if the damage is reduced with  Repulsion Armor Plates.\nThe healing radius is placed at the holder's feet, or any ground straight below within 500m.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\u201cYou have a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?

It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the The Basics Challenge.\nWhen the holder attacks an enemy that has more than 90% of its health remaining, they deal 75% more damage (+75% per stack). \n\n\n== Notes ==\nAfter stacking two or more Crowbars, the total damage dealt is greater than a critical strike.\nThis item is best used with Survivors with high single-hit damage, such as   Loader,   Artificer,   Captain, and   Railgunner.\nHowever, all Survivors can make effective use of the Crowbar with equipment such as the  Preon Accumulator or  Royal Capacitor.\nThe bonus damage from the Crowbar is calculated on a per-hit basis, so extra attacks from total damage items do not account for its bonus damage, unless they also hit an enemy that is above 90% health.\nCrowbars, and similarly   Voidsent Flame, can become difficult to use in multiplayer or with damage-dealing allies, as they can reduce an enemy's health below 90% and prevent one from utilizing the damage increase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM CARGO BAY 5 OF UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\u201cHey, toss me a crowbar?\u201d\n\nJesse walked over to the toolbox and rummaged around. Plucking a crowbar from the container, she went over to James.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he grunted, attempting to pry the chest open. Jesse sat herself on the table next to James, idly watching him work. \u201cI swear, this had to be the one chest that CAN\u2019T be paid open... Crash must have... broken the circuitry inside.\u201d James mumbled to himself.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jesse looked around, her eyes falling on a palette of chests that had been recovered from the recent expeditions. Sighing, she hopped to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m heading to the mess hall. Want anything?\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, how about a better crowbar? This thing is only a second edition.\u201d James stretched, tossing the crowbar over his shoulder. Patting the still unopened chest, he chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s good, but to be honest\u2026 it\u2019s getting a little old.\u201d\n\nJesse laughed.\n\n\n== Version History ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Crowbar is a reference to the Half Life series created by Valve, in which the main character Gordon Freeman uses a crowbar similar to the one depicted as his melee weapon.\nThe text from the first game's logbook entry, \"until the 3rd edition arrives,\" as well as this game's updated entry adding that \"the second edition\" is \"getting a little old\" are digs at the long production time of the Half-Life series and Valve's seeming dislike of the number 3, going as far as making Half-Life 1, 2 and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2. Because of this, Half-Life 3 has become a well-known point of humor on the internet joking about how it will never come out.\nThe logbook entry may also be a reference to the Pok\u00e9mon anime, in which a pair of characters also named Jesse and James are thieves for the criminal organization known as Team Rocket. In the series, James is often found doing all the physical labor, while Jesse slacks off or raids the remaining food or supplies the duo have. They also consistently have little to no money in the series, reflected by how the pair are breaking into a chest whose payment mechanism is broken.",

            "notes": "The Delicate Watch is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nIt increases all the holder's damage by 20% (+20% per stack). However, when the holder takes damage that brings them below 25% of their maximum health, all stacks of this item is removed from the inventory and an equal amount of  Delicate Watch (Broken) is added. Broken Watches have no effect and cannot be scrapped.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nWhile the player is holding this item, a faint black line will appear over the health bar at the 25% mark, indicating when this item will break.\nDespite the item description specifying that watch will break below 25% health, it is actually based on combined health (i.e. health plus shields), similar to the  Fuel Array. This allows the item and its drawback to function normally even for a character with more than three times as much shield as health, such as one holding a  Transcendence.\nWhen falling below 25% health, the  Unstable Transmitter's effect has priority triggering, followed by the  Power Elixir's. Only when the Unstable Transmitter is on cooldown and all Power Elixirs are used will the Delicate Watch's effect trigger.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nHaving an  Unstable Transmitter and/or a  Power Elixir can help prevent Delicate Watches from breaking, as their effects take priority over its own.\nThe Delicate Watch acts similiarly to  Focus Crystal but without the distance restriction. If the player can avoid breaking them, the Delicate Watch provides a damage increase at all distances.\nPaying the second or third offering at a Shrine of Blood can break this item immediately. This can be negated with enough barrier or blocked by  Safer Spaces, among other methods.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe wind blows over the plains. Two soldiers trudge along on their routine patrol, filling their boredom with casual conversation. \"Hm. Hey, Shelly, have I ever showed you my new Patex?\" Quinton mused. Shelly shot him a quizzical look. \"Tell me you didn't bring a $75,000 watch with you on a dangerous expedition into unknown territories...\"\n\nWhirling around to face his partner, Quinton gave a hearty laugh. \"Why, yes I did!\" Rolling up his sleeve, a glint of gold revealed his collector's watch. The metal surface gleamed proudly, reflecting a ray of sunlight into the eyes of a hidden Lemurian. \"What's the point of going through trials and tribulations in the middle of nowhere if I can't STYLE all over my fellow soldiers!?\" Quinton laughed, pounding his fist to his chest. \"I'm going to rub it in your face SO HARD when that thing inevitably breaks,\" Shelly chuckled. Quinton scoffed. \"Oh, please. We've been along this route countless times, and nothing's happened. We're lucky to be stationed on a quiet sector of this hellhole, and I doubt our luck will run out any time soon.\"\n\nAs if on cue, the aggrivated Lemurian, annoyed by the glare, leapt from the bushes and shot a fireball. \"Woah!\" Shelly shouted, raising her gun and killing the beast. \"Hah... So much about a quiet, sector, huh?\" Shelly turned to her partner, who was doubled over on the ground. Shelly's face blanched.\n\n\"Oh no... Were you hit? We need to get you to a medic, fast...!\"\n\n\"No.\" Quinton's voice was small and full of grief. \"I'm perfectly fine, but...\" Quinton looked up, revealing his gleaming Patex, having taken the fireball dead-on, had been reduced to a mangled mess of twisted metal and smoking polish. \"L-Look what that BEAST did to my precious watch!\"\n\nFor a moment, all was quiet on the plains. Then, the silence was yet again broken by Shelly's laughter and Quinton's desperate pleading.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Delicate Watch\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item's pickup quote on breaking is a reference to the common saying \"A stopped clock is right twice a day\".\nThis item's model in the Logbook displays accurate time according to the user's computer's time. Zooming in close enough will allow you to see the large clock hand move in real time.\nThe item's brand name of Patex in the log entry is most likely a reference to Patek Philippe, a famous Swiss watch brand that makes extremely expensive and, for the most part, delicate watches.",

The buff will only be applied once in a proc chain.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description does not specify the buff's duration resetting upon damaging enemies.\nThe buff's duration will be reset even if the player is below the enemy.\nThe item triggers when the attacker\u2019s center is at least one radius (\u2248 half their height) above the target\u2019s center, meaning the attacker\u2019s feet only need to reach roughly the target\u2019s mid-body to activate the bonus.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n Hopoo Feather,  Faraday Spur, and  H3AD-5T v2 synergize very well with this item, allowing a consistent way to get above most enemies.\nAt 10 stacks or more of Hiker's Boots, you can reach 100% critical strike chance. Given this,  Lost Seer's Lenses are more appealing with Hiker's Boots, as  Lens-Maker's Glasses are no longer required to guarantee critical strikes.\nCertain survivors will benefit greatly from this item, as they have ways to consistently stay above their enemies.\n  Artificer's   Ion Surge combined with   ENV Suit.\n  Mercenary can chain his skills together to stay in the air, along with his natural double jump.\n  Operator's   Ascent Protocol with enough drones.\nDue to   Railgunner's   Magnetic Accelerator, her critical strike damage will increase by 2% (+2% per item stack) per stack of the buff.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Altitude-Safety Hiking Boots \n\nTracking Number: 05015*********** \n\nEstimated Delivery: 04/13/2056 \n\nShipping Method:  Standard \n\nShipping Address: Mountain Outpost 041-C, Nepal, Earth \n\nShipping Details: \n\nGrabbed these boots from the market.

At 10 stacks a critical strike chance is guaranteed, effectively doubling all damage output.\nAcquiring more than 10 stacks will bring no additional benefit unless the player is planning to eventually corrupt it to  Lost Seer's Lenses.\nCritical strike chance is affected by Luck.\nCritical strikes applies to the damage dealt by equipment, such as the  Royal Capacitor.\nCritical strike chance is not affected by the damage source's proc coefficient. As an example, those using   MUL-T's   Auto-Nailgun will not have to collect additional Lens-Maker's Glasses to compensate for the skill's lowered chance to proc.\nCritical strikes are calculated after items like  Focus Crystal and  Shaped Glass, doubling their effectiveness.\n  Railgunner has a unique synergy with this item due to her   Magnetic Accelerator passive. Any critical strike chance is converted directly into critical strike damage, meaning this item would instead increase her critical strike damage by 10%. As such, this item can be stacked past 10 stacks and beyond for increased damage.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nWhile the effective limit for regular critical hit chance is 10 Lens-Maker's Glasses, it is wise to stop stacking at 9. The first stack of  Predatory Instincts,  Harvester's Scythe and  Shatterspleen all grant a 5% increase to critical strike chance, so holding at least two of the three items acts a substitute for a single Lens-Maker's Glasses.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u2026What I didn\u2019t see was that the golem was aiming its laser at my back. I managed to barely dodge it - just by pure luck - but the blast knocked me to the ground.

This makes the item ineffective for recovering from most damage-over-time effects or rapidly-firing attacks.\nAs {  Medkit Heal is a buff, it can not be cleared to activate its effects early by using  Blast Shower.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAt 20+ stacks, receiving Medkit healing will fully recover the player's health. The number required to do this is reduced by having any  Rejuvenation Racks; having one Rack requires half as many Medkits (10), having two Racks requires a third as many (7), so on and so forth.\nIf the player intentionally takes damage less than the amount they would recover, such as slight fall damage or suffocation from the   Void Fields, the Medkit can be used to gain net positive health, albeit slowly.\n Tougher Times can afford the player more opportunities to heal, as it can block damage that would otherwise reset the Medkit's charge time.\nObtaining the  Strides of Heresy affords the player enough time to receive the Medkit's healing, in addition to the extra healing that comes from   Shadowfade.

This value starts at 3 gold (+3 per stack) and is multiplied by the difficulty coefficient. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description mentioning that the damage must originate from an enemy is incorrect, the item's effect is triggered for sources of damage originating from a character other than the holder of the item.\nThis means self-damaging effects, such as the  Helfire Tincture,   REX's \"plant\" skills,   Captain's Diablo Strike, and   Void Fiend's Corrupted Suppress do not trigger it.\nHowever, in Multiplayer,   Captain's Diablo Strike and  Helfire Tincture can be used by a different player on this item's holder to gain extra money, while the former is an extremely impractical method, the latter is very profitable to an almost gamebreaking degree earlygame: since the hellfire damage ticks 5 times per second and lasts up to 15 seconds, activating it will trigger roll of pennies a total of 75 times for a gold amount equal to the price of 9 small chests, the total burn damage caused is 30% of the hellfire holder's max HP to themselves and 15% of the hellfire holder's max HP to the roll of pennies holder's HP (this means that, depending on how much health the hellfire holder has, the roll of pennies holder will take varying amounts of damage), but both values can be reduced drastically with even a single  Repulsion Armor Plate or  Planula, or compensated with any healing items.\nThe {  Void Fog and fall damage also do not trigger it as they are sources of damage not linked to any character.\nThe explosive containers in   Abandoned Aqueduct and   Rallypoint Delta do trigger it as they are immovable characters.\nA projectile or persistent attack, such as the   Mini Mushrum's Blazing Pool, that hits the player after the enemy has died will not trigger the effect. Dying here does not mean the enemy's health reaching zero, but the enemy's death animation completing. As such, the   Lunar Chimera's (Exploder) death effect will not trigger the item since the blazing pool in this case spawns after the death animation has finished.\nAn animation of a flying gold coin will play when this item's effect activates, and the animation will show more coins the more stacks the player has.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item activates on any instance of enemy damage, regardless of its proc coefficient. This includes damage over time effects, which will activate the item's effect for every individual tick of damage.\nThis means that intentionally letting enemies inflict {  Burn or {  Bleed can be an effective way to rapidly generate money, especially when combined with a  Repulsion Armor Plate to mitigate the damage. Note that  Ben's Raincoat renders this strategy somewhat less effective.\nTaking damage from a   Solus Probe's beam, or standing in the damage zone of a   Mini Mushrum's spore bomb are also effective ways to generate money.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe sounds of gunfire rang in Johnson's ears. Biting down and tugging on the bandage covering his wounded leg, he hastily reloaded his firearm.\n\nFor a moment, before he fired on the Lemurians who had pinned his team into a corner and already claimed two of his friends, Johnson reflected on what brought him here.\n\nJohnson had grown up in poverty, the oldest of three children. He had started working at a young age to support his sick mother and younger siblings, and all his life he bounced from one odd job to the next. Anything that could rake in the cash. Anything that would pay the bills.\n\n\"'An expedition into unknown territories, seeking volunteers,'\" his recruiter read in between puffs of his cigar. \"Lot of classified info, don't know too much myself... But it pays a lot. And I know you need the money. You in, Johnny-boy?\" At the time, Johnson had thought to himself, 'it couldn't be that bad.'\n\nJohnson returned to the battlefield, gunning down Lemurians in an effort to save his remaining friends. The wound on his leg ached, dying the bandage red with blood. 'It couldn't be that bad,' he had thought. \"Yeah, right.\" Johnson scoffed. \"At least I'm getting paid after this.\"\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Roll of Pennies\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nLooking closely at the penny's model in the logbook shows that instead of reading \"In God We Trust\" like a standard United States penny, it reads \"In Paul We Trust.\" This is a reference to Paul Morse, one of the two founders of Hopoo Games, who also has  Paul's Goat Hoof named after him.\nThere is also a stone golem carved on the back of each penny.",

This means Bleed can be stacked infinitely as long as it is continuously inflicted.\nHowever, hits with a low proc coefficient will inflict shorter-duration stacks of Bleed, meaning that even with 100% Bleed chance, the window to inflict the next Bleed stack to refresh existing ones is much narrower.\nThe Tri-Tip Dagger's chance to activate stacks linearly 10%.

Depending on the drones he has purchased,   ADMIN-OVERRIDE can also inflict   Burn with an   Incinerator Drone,   50% Slow with a   Cleanup Drone,   Jailed with a   Jailer Drone, and   Frost with a   Freeze Drone.\n  Drifter can inflict an extremely wide variety of debuffs using   Cleanup,   Discard (from   Repossess), and   Tinker.\n  Cleanup can apply   Hemorrhage or   Burn depending on the random projectile she rolls.\nThrowing an object with   Discard can apply   Nullify Stack if she throws a Void Cradle,   Cripple if she throws a Lunar Pod or Cleansing Pool, and   Burn if she throws a   Lesser Wisp,   Greater Wisp, or Lunar Chimera   Exploder or   Wisp.\n  Tinker can inflict one of 22 different debuffs to any enemy it hits. 10 of these are unused or otherwise impossible to inflict with survivors or items, 6 can be inflicted by other survivors, and 6 can only be inflicted by items or equipments.\n\n\n=== Item Debuffs ===\nWhile the Death Mark is best used with Survivors who can inflict debuffs naturally, there are many items that inflict debuffs as well:\n\n Tri-Tip Dagger,  Noxious Thorn,  Shatterspleen and  Sawmerang inflict   Bleed.\nThe  Tri-Tip Dagger and  Shatterspleen require multiple stacks and high critical chance for reliability, respectively.\nThe  Needletick inflicts   Collapse, but corrupts Tri-Tip Daggers. Bleed can still be inflicted with the Noxious Thorn, Shatterspleen, Sawmerang or by other players, however.\n Gasoline, the  Molten Perforator, and the  Molotov (6-Pack) will   ignite enemies.\n Ifrit's Distinction allows the holder to ignite enemies with all their skills and items.\nThe  Ignition Tank changes Ignite into   Stronger Burn. While this does not add debuffs, it does mean that a player with the Ignition Tank can inflict Stronger Burn while their allies can still inflict regular Ignite, which count separately. This can be facilitated with an   Incinerator Drone.\n Chronobauble inflicts   60% Slow, which can be maintained easily with even a single stack.\nThe  Tentabauble inflicts   Nullified, but corrupts Chronobaubles. 60% Slow can still be inflicted by other players who have Chronobaubles, however.\n Runald's Band inflicts   80% Slow when activated, though this can make the Death Mark tied to the Elemental Bands cooldown.\n Breaching Fin inflicts   Breaching Fin Debuff, though this can make the Death Mark tied to the Breaching Fin cooldown.\n Shattering Justice inflicts   Pulverize Buildup and   Pulverized (though never at the same time), which both count towards Death Mark.\n Symbiotic Scorpion inflicts   Permanent Armor Reduction.\n Frost Relic inflicts   80% Slow.\n Networked Suffering inflicts computer virus.\n Hooks of Heresy allow the holder to inflict   Lunar Root using   Slicing Maelstrom.\n Essence of Heresy allows the holder to inflict   Ruin on hit, as long as the   Ruin skill is not on cooldown.\n Mired Urn inflicts   Tar on one nearby enemy per stack.\n Helfire Tincture inflicts the invisible   Helfire debuff, which does contribute towards the Death Mark.\n Her Biting Embrace and the  Spectral Circlet allow the holder to apply   80% Slow on hit.\n N'kuhana's Retort allows the holder to   disable healing on hit.\n Shared Design and  Effigy of Grief inflict   Cripple.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: \u201cDeath Mark\u201d\n\nTracking Number: 66******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 02\\22\\2056\\\n\nShipping Method:  High Priority\n\nShipping Address: 421 Lane, Lab [72], Mars\n\nShipping Details:\n\nEveryone said that I was crazy to search for lost artifacts on Mars.

Each debuff actually has 2 components: an invisible debuff that deals the damage, and a visible positive buff that creates the icon and indicates that the debuff is inflicted. This is why the Helfire debuff counts towards the Death Mark, even though it is invisible: it has the debuff component, just not the visible buff. However, due to a programming error, both components of Collapse were treated as debuffs.\nThis has been fixed as of Patch 1.2.3.",

One stack of the buff is consumed upon hitting an enemy after using a primary skill, dealing 175% total damage (+50% per item stack). The buff can be stacked up to 5 times (+1 per stack).\nAdditionally, the first stack of Luminous Shot grants 20% secondary skill cooldown reduction.\nEach lighting bolt has a proc coefficient of 1.0\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis point seems to be incorrect for   MUL-T as of the Alloyed Collective update, you can repeatedly trigger the item's effect while holding down   Auto-Nailgun as a primary skill while using   Power Mode, might be the case for other survivors as well. - It is worth to note that the   Increased Primary Damage buff will only trigger if the primary skill was used after gaining the first stack. If the first stack of the buff is acquired during the use of a primary skill, that instance of the the skill will never trigger the buff. This can occur, for example, if any variation of the   Loader grapple is used during a hit of   Knuckleboom but is especially present with skills that can be used indefinitely such as   MUL-T if using   Power Mode in combination with   Power-Saw or   Auto-Nailgun as those skills will not be able to use the buff until completely re-initiated. This effectively means no one instance of a skill will ever be able to use   Increased Primary Damage more than once.\n  Railgunner doesn't actually gain the buff from using the secondary skills but from firing out the transformed primary skill, which also cannot use the buff through any means, forcing her to trigger it through   XQR Smart Round System.\n  MUL-T cannot trigger the lightning strikes in   Power Mode when using two of the same weapon, but using the secondary weapon will still stack the buff.\nThis item is especially strong with  Backup Magazine.\nThe  Shuriken does not trigger the buff.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAs   MUL-T, repeatedly using his second primary skill while in   Power Mode can allow for quick accumulation of buff stacks.\nThis is especially apparent when using   Power-Saw as the second primary skill, giving a stack each time the button to trigger the skill is pressed. This effectively allows the player to stack buffs as quickly as they can press the Secondary button.\nSurvivors that have very low cooldown secondary abilities like   Acrid,   Mercenary and   REX, or multiple uses for secondary abilities like   False Son or   Operator can easily ramp up the stacks.\nIf   Mercenary activates the Luminous Shot hit on an attack that applies   Expose, it will subsequently trigger the effect on its own.\nEven better, if Luminous Shot activates from a hit on an Exposed enemy, the damage of each lightning strike will be based on the Expose-boosted damage. For instance, with one item stack, instead of doing 227.5% damage (130% x 1.75 = 227.5%), each strike will do 840% damage ([130% + 350%] * 1.75 = 480% * 1.75 = 840%).\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Results are in!\nThe 2057 NextTech winner is the Luminous Shot, crafted by Inventor M.

Therefore,    Overloading Elites effectively have a maximum execution threshold of 50% health.\nHowever,   Perfected Elites can be executed as normal at the appropriate threshold.\nThis item can be particularly useful for   Acrid if using   Poison, as it will allow the usually non-lethal passive to kill elite enemies the moment they fall below the threshold.\nThe Old Guillotine is one of the few items in the game with hyperbolic stacking.\n24 Old Guillotines are required to overcome the bonus health for Tier 1 Elite enemies (  Blazing ,  Overloading,   Glacial, and   Perfected), and 131 are needed to overcome the health bonus of Tier 2 Elites (  Malachite and   Celestine).\n  Voidtouched elites are affected by this item.\n  Void Infestor can infest and make a high health, previously non-elite enemy easier to kill as a result.\nSurvivors, and by extension Umbra of Survivors, are unable to be executed.\n  Engineer's   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret and   TR58 Carbonizer Turret are able to be executed if they are elite.\nThe execution threshold visual will still increase.\nit would take around 111*^317 old guillotines in order to have a 100% threshold\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe threshold at which it will activate is determined by the formula: \nthresHold=(1\u2212100100+13*items)*100;\n\nThe item effectively increase damage against elites by 13%, even if the thresholds differ.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Old Guillotine\n\nTracking Number: 782*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 04/29/2056\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: Warehouse 36, Anklar, Primas V \n\nShipping Details:\n\nEveryone is still operating on adrenaline here.

Instead it applies an 80% slow to them.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Should memories be lost,\n\nShould oceans be clouded,\n\nWill you bring me fervor?\n\nWill you die with me?\"\n\n-The Syzygy of Io and Europa\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nRunald\u2019s/Kjaro\u2019s Band  Developer Notes: The two rings have undergone a bit of a rework, working off of an internal cooldown rather than a chance on-hit.

            "notes": "The Shipping Request Form is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nWhen entering a new stage, if any player has this item, a Crashed Multishop \"Delivery\" will spawn somewhere in the stage (one per player who has a Shipping Request Form). The \"delivery\" is a burning Multishop Terminal which is different from a normal one in a few ways: it costs no gold to use, it has only 2 choices instead of the usual 3, and one of those 2 choices is a question mark icon (meaning the item of that rarity is unknown).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe crashed Multishop will never display any equipment.\nTerminals spawn even when the Artifact of Sacrifice is active.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe weight for each tier of item is calculated as follows:\n\n.79 for common\n.2 * n for uncommon\n.01 * n^2 for legendary\nWhere n is the amount of Shipping Request Form.\nTo calculate the chance for a tier, add together all weights then divide that tier's weight by the total sum of all weights.\nFor example, if a player has 2 Shipping Request Form items, then the weights are 0.79 (common), 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 (uncommon), 0.01 * 2^2 = 0.04 (legendary). Then, the chance an item is legendary is 0.04 / (0.79 + 0.4 + 0.04) = 0.04 / 1.23, or approximately 0.0325, around 3%.\nThe table below shows the probabilities calculates for each value of n. Note however that each delivery includes 2 choices. See the section below for odds of at least one legendary.\n\n\n== Graph ==\n\n\n== At least 1 Legendary ==\nEach item tier is independent of each other, but each delivery drop contains 2 items. You can calculate the probability of getting at least one item from a tier by using the complement: 1 - (1 - x) ^ 2, where x is the probability of getting at least one that tier (shown above).\nFor example, with a stack of 3, the chance of one item being chosen as legendary is 6% = 0.06. The chance that it is not legendary is 1 - 0.06, so the chance that both are not legendary is (1 - 0.06)^2. The complement of this is the chance that at least one is legendary:  1 - (1 - .06)^2, roughly 11.5%.\nThe table below shows the probability that at least one legendary item will appear a given stack of Shipping Request Form.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nHaving the  Executive Card allows the player to obtain both items from the delivery, instead of choosing one over another.\nThis is even more effective in multiplayer when multiple players have Shipping Request Forms; the player with the Executive Card can open each of the other players' deliveries for them.\nUsing the  Radar Scanner allows the player to find the Crashed Multishop \"Delivery\" faster, as it will be represented as two adjacent chest icons () upon scan.\nIn multiplayer, all stacks of Shipping Request Form from every player will increase the item rarity of each Multishop spawned from this item. For example, if a player has 5 stacks of this item while another player has 1, both multishops that spawn from the two players holding it will have the item rarity of having 6 Shipping Request Form. So it is not advised for one person in multiplayer to hoard all the Shipping Request Forms, as you lose out on more loot.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThis is an automated message.

            "notes": "The Shuriken is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nThe item grants the   Shuriken buff, which stacks up to 3 (+1 per stack) times over 10 seconds. When the holder's primary skill is used, a shuriken projectile is launched forward at the same time, dealing 400% (+100% per stack) damage with a 1.0 Proc Coefficient and consuming one stack of the Shuriken buff.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe projectiles weakly home in on enemies, but in practice this can actually be a liability, because it often prioritize closer enemies instead of what the player is aiming at. Due to how slowly the projectile curves, this usually results in missing both enemies.\nNon-primary skills can also throw Shurikens if they use the primary attack input, since these work by temporarily replacing the primary skill. For instance, this means that   Railgunner will always activate the Shuriken when shooting, as her other skills simply change the effect of her primary. The same applies when aiming   Captain's   Orbital Probe and   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike, and when firing   Engineer's   Thermal Harpoons.\nIn addition to this. certain  survivors will activate the shuriken before actually firing. Such as   Captain's vulcan shotgun firing while aiming. Or   Engineer's bouncing grenades firing before the engineer releases them.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe charge cooldown is determined by the formula f(x)=10(amount+2).\n\n\n== Tips ==\nShurikens on melee-based characters like   Acrid or   Loader can give them a ranged attack while activating their primary.\nHowever,   Loader does not gain barrier from Shurikens, as her passive only affects her gauntlets.\nShurikens on   Captain are harder to utilize, as they activate as soon as he charges his primary, rather than when he releases the shot.\nThe lock-on attacks for   Huntress can activate Shurikens, but will only work with a target in sight.\nA single stack of Shurikens deals enough damage to activate the  Kjaro's,  Runald's, and  Singularity Bands, allowing characters such as   Engineer and   Commando to more consistently activate them. Conversely, characters with strong single-hit skills can lose out on damage output if Shurikens activate bands instead.\nNotably, Engineer's turrets can use Shurikens with their attack, allowing them to use the Bands as well.\nShuriken stacking has both diminishing and quadratic returns. One stack of Shurikens can deal 1200% base damage per ten seconds. A second stack only increases this by 800% base damage, however each additional stack adds 200% more than the last (D=(x+200%)(x+300%)), as both the number of shurikens and the damage they deal increases.\nThis means that while Shurikens might not stack well normally, if you find a printer, they can become extremely powerful. At six stacks, the quadratic damage growth will get a very considerable return. However it's still not enough to cancel out the diminishing returns of stacking unless you can find sufficient stacks of Shurikens. Going beyond six stacks can increase your DPS by leaps and bounds.\nShurikens are extremely dangerous if monsters gain them (such as in the   Void Fields, with the Artifact of Evolution enabled, or if the monster is a   Scavenger or the   final boss), as they deal large amounts of damage and are difficult to avoid due to their high velocity. If the monsters also have Kjaro's or Runald's Band, even a single shuriken can kill the player.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Aluminum Throwing Star\n\nTracking Number: 77******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 05/15/2060\n\nShipping Method: Priority\n\nShipping Address: Sensei Dareth's Mojo Dojo, Earth\n\nShipping Details:\n\nFor the last time, shouting \"hiyahh!\" when throwing a shuriken will NOT improve your results.

            "desc": "All random effects are rolled +1 (+1 per stack) times for a favorable outcome .",
            "notes": "The 57 Leaf Clover is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the The Long Road Challenge.\nThe Clover makes random beneficial effects more likely to occur for the holder, and as such is the counterpart to the  Purity (which makes beneficial effects less likely to occur). It affects all random effects except  Tougher Times. \nIf a successful proc is not achieved on a roll, it will be rolled one additional time per Clover. For example, assume the player has one item that has a 20% chance to proc a beneficial effect on-hit, and has one 57 Leaf Clover. If the player attacks, and the item does not activate, the roll will be done once more, as the player has one Clover. \nSuccesses are measured per effect, not as a whole. If one item roll is successful, other items that were triggered by the same proc will continue to roll if unsuccessful.\nSince items from chests are created based on the world seed, the Clover does not affect them.\n\n\n== Math ==\nIn order to calculate proc probability with a certain number of Clovers, the following equation can be used:\ny = 1 - (1 - p)^(x + 1)\nWhere:\n\np = total item proc chance (between 0 and 1)\nx = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.\ny = new item proc chance (between 0 and 1) with x amount of Clovers.\n\nThe inverse of the equation, to find the number of Clovers required to achieve a certain proc probability, is:\nx = (log(1 - y) / log(1 - p)) - 1\nNote that this is a logarithmic equation. As such, it is impossible to achieve 100% proc chance on an effect (regardless of the number of Clovers held), unless the base chance is already 100%.\nIn order to calculate proc probability with a certain number of Clovers and a certain number of times a proc chance is rolled, the following equation can be used:\ny = 1 - ((1 - p)^(x + 1))^t\nWhere:\n\np = total proc chance (between 0 and 1)\nx = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.\nt = the amount of times a proc chance is rolled.\ny = new proc chance (between 0 and 1) with x amount of Clovers and t amount of times the proc chance is rolled.\nThis equation is useful for calculating logbook drop chances for multi-phase bosses, like   Voidling and   Mithrix, or more uncommon enemies, like   Overloading Worms.\n\n\n== Interaction with Purity ==\nIn the game code, the number of Clovers is referred to as \"Luck,\" with each Clover giving +1 Luck. There are no other means of acquiring positive Luck. Negative Luck is also supported, and can be obtained via the lunar item  Purity. Positive and negative Luck will cancel each other out, and thus an equal number of Clovers and Purity will equate to 0 Luck.\nThe game runs a proc chance Abs(Luck) times, where Luck is the total amount after Clovers (positive) & Purities (negative) are applied.\nIf the player has 7 Clovers and 5 Purity, the 5 Purity will cancel out 5 of the Clovers, resulting in a net +2 Luck. This means any given proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a positive outcome. If the amount of each item is switched, resulting in -2 Luck, the proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a negative outcome; this can also be seen as the proc chance needing to successfully roll three times for it to proc (once for the initial roll and two more for each negative Luck).\n\n\n== Exhaustive List of Clover Effects ==\nLuck does not affect chest spawns or contents, Shrine of Chance outcomes, the chance for an  Artifact Key to drop, or the chance for monsters to drop items with the Artifact of Sacrifice enabled.\n\n\n=== Survivor Effects ===\nCritical strike chance. Survivors have a base 1.0% critical strike chance.\n  Artificer's chance to   Burn with   Flamethrower (50% base chance).\n  Heretic's chance to inflict   Ruin on hit (base chance is equal to the proc coefficient of the damage).\n\n\n=== Item Effects ===\n Lens-Maker's Glasses' chance to critical hit.\n Stun Grenade's chance to stun a target.\n Tri-Tip Dagger's chance to   Bleed a target.\n Sticky Bomb's chance to attach a sticky bomb.\n Ukulele's chance to fire chain lightning.\n AtG Missile Mk. 1's chance to fire a missile.\n Bandolier's chance to drop an ammo pack.\n Ghor's Tome's chance to drop a gold nugget.\n Sale Star's chance to grant additional items.\n Chance Doll's chance to replace the Shrine of Chance loot table.\n Sentient Meat Hook's chance to hook enemies.\n Happiest Mask's chance to spawn a ghost.\n Electric Boomerang's chance to fire a boomerang.\n Runic Lens' chance to summon a meteor.\n Sonorous Whispers' chance to drop an item on Elite kill.\n Molten Perforator's chance to fire magma balls.\n Charged Perforator's chance to summon a lightning bolt.\n Saut\u00e9ed Worms' chance to summon a spectral worm.\n Brittle Crown's chance to gain gold.\n Spinel Tonic's chance to get a  Tonic Affliction.

Monsters have 0% base critical strike chance.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nIt was a massacre. The orbital probes had incinerated both the battalion and the enemy\u2013 as well as the entire plateau. There was no life left to be found - except for one lone soldier.\n\nThe soldier trudged through the scorched plains, numbly looking for any survivors.\n\nBut he found none.\n\nThe soldier tried to find water \u2013 he had only just noticed how thirsty he was, and how much his head hurt. How much his heart hurt.\n\nBut he found none.\n\nThe soldier tried to remember, why he was out on this terrible mission, and why he had to say goodbye to so many.\n\nBut he found none.\n\nThe soldier tried to find anything \u2013 anything that could justify why he was alive. Some semblance of meaning \u2013 or hope.\n\nAnd he found one.\n\nA small leaf, peeking out from a pile of ash. He gently plucked the clover out of the ground \u2013 somehow, it survived hours of orbital bombardments. \n\nWith clover in hand, the soldier began the long trek to report back to his superiors. Was this divine intervention? Was there some meaning \u2013 some reason as to why both him and this little clover survived? \n\nOr were they just lucky?\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: 57 Leaf Clover\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe 57 Leaf Clover is the successor to the 56 Leaf Clover from the first Risk of Rain. The 56 Leaf Clover did not interact with chance effects, but instead gave a chance for Elite monsters to drop random items upon defeat.\nThis behavior is partially carried over to Risk of Rain 2, as the 57 Leaf Clover affects the chance for Elite monsters to drop their Elite equipment.\nBefore the Artifacts update, the unreleased code for the Artifact of Sacrifice would check for the Luck of the killer. This is no longer the case.\nBefore the full release of Risk of Rain 2,  Runald's Band and  Kjaro's Band were affected by the Luck stat, and therefore were more likely to proc when the player had a Clover. This is no longer the case, as the 1.0 update revamped both Bands.\nAn interesting leftover of this design change is that Kjaro and Runald, the two   Elder Lemurians who spawn with the Bands in the   Abandoned Aqueduct, also both spawn with 20 stacks of 57 Leaf Clovers.\nFor every frame that the Clover's effect is triggered at least once, a chime sound can be heard. This is hard to notice when striking an enemy, but it can also be triggered when the player takes damage while holding a  Razorwire, since the item will roll for critical strike before searching for valid targets. As such, being under the effect of the   Void Fog makes this more noticeable.",

But with 3+ stacks, there will be a positive accumulation of barrier. Similarly, 4 or more stacks of  Weeping Fungus also has the same positive effect.\nFor optimal barrier gain in conjunction with  Rejuvenation Rack, the amount of Aegis and Rejuvenation Racks should be equal, with Aegis taking priority.

Most of these will either fail to activate or just refresh the current equipment's effect duration, for which no time has passed anyway.\nKeep in mind the user cannot kill two lined up bosses with  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn because the equipment is instantly transformed into its consumed version before Bottled Chaos' effect is activated.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe one planet they couldn't take.\n\nThey had everything locked away in their cells.\n\nBeasts, artifacts of power, gods, memories.\n\nAnd yet, no matter how many agents they sent, none returned victorious... if they returned at all.\n\nThe lucky ones who did survive fled, nervously whispering of a crystalline blade stained with chaos.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Bottled Chaos\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe \"crystalline blade\" mentioned in the item's lore is referring to the sword wielded by Providence.\nThis suggests that void monsters had previously tried to invade Petrichor V but were driven away by Providence, explaining why no void enemies appeared in Risk of Rain 1.

The radius of each explosion is multiplied by the attack's proc coefficient, so damage that has a proc coefficient of 0.0 (e.g.   Bleed from the  Tri-Tip Dagger) will not explode. \nThe explosion itself has a proc coefficient of 0.0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of (+1.5m per stack) is incorrect.\nUnlike all other total damage items, the Brilliant Behemoth strangely inherits the attack type of the triggering hit. This means that the explosion can:\nGrant stacks of   Bandit Skull when killing enemies, if the triggering hit is   Bandit's   Desperado.\nAdd an extra stack of   Expose when triggered by a hit that inflicts it.\nDeal additional damage from the Slayer keyword if the triggering attack has that keyword.\nInstantly kill enemies using the  Lost Seer's Lenses, if the triggering attack succeeded the instant-kill roll.\nBecause the Behemoth will not check if the enemy is a boss when inheriting the instant-kill type, this means that bosses are not immune to being instantly killed by the Behemoth if the player instantly kills a non-boss enemy that is close by (as bosses are only \"immune\" because the Lost Seer's Lenses will not roll the chance to kill them). This does not work on either of the       final bosses, however, as they are immune to this damage type altogether.\nAttacks create explosions when damaging an enemy or impacting a surface, even if the projectile is not destroyed on contact with terrain. This means that   Frag Grenades create explosions when bouncing off terrain, and the projectiles from the  Ceremonial Dagger and  Egocentrism will constantly explode when piercing through terrain.\nThis also means that an attack that normally explodes, such as   Charged Nano-Bomb, will create an additional explosion in the attack's center thanks to the Behemoth. However, any enemy damaged by the original explosion will also explode due to the Behemoth. If the enemy is close enough to the original explosion's center, it can take damage from the Behemoth twice: once from the explosion created by the attack's impact, and once from the explosion created when the attack damages it.\nThe same exploding effect occurs with the   Overloading exploding orbs.\nThe explosion will usually damage the enemy that the attack was triggered on, making Brilliant Behemoth at worst a flat +60% multiplicative damage upgrade in addition to potentially hitting other enemies with the explosions.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cLasers have their speed.

This ability recharges every 0.5 seconds, although it recharges faster with greater attack speed. The maximum number of projectiles that can be shot down at once is equal to the number of held Microbots.\nAlthough the Defensive Microbots have a defined rarity, they cannot be found in Chests, traded for using Cauldrons or 3D Printers, or obtained through any other typical method. They are near-exclusive to the   Captain, who is granted one due to his   passive skill of the same name.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nMany attacks that aren't conventional projectiles can be destroyed, such as   Mini Mushrum spore clouds and fire pools,   Alloy Worship Unit's Alloy Supercharged Detonation, {  Malachite Elite urchin pits, {  Gilded Elite spikes, {  Overloading Elite bombs, the   Wandering Vagrant's Homing Orb Bomb,   Lunar Chimera Exploder's fiery blaze,   Beetle Queen's acid pools,   Imp Overlord's lingering shatter spikes, as well as   Mithrix's blue flame pillars and the shockwaves generated by his shockwave attack and phase 3 hammer slam.

This is only relevant if the Artifact of Vengeance is active (if an Umbra has Microbots), the Artifact of Chaos is active, or if the   final boss steals Microbots during his final phase.\nThere are only two legitimate methods of obtaining Defensive Microbots, other than starting a run as Captain:\nRisking a Shrine of Order can convert all other held legendary items into Microbots.\nEnabling the Artifact of Metamorphosis and randomly becoming the Captain during a stage. His passive skill will grant the player the item, which will remain in the player's inventory even after metamorphosing into a different Survivor.\nWhen starting a run as the Captain and beginning the Trial of Metamorphosis in Bulwark's Ambry, the randomly chosen Survivor will keep the Defensive Microbots for the rest of the run.\nIn past versions of the game, enabling the Artifact of Vengeance and defeating an Umbra of Captain could drop Microbots.

            "notes": "The H3AD-5T v2 is an item in Risk of Rain 2.\nWhile mid-air, you can begin charging a ground slam by holding [Interact] key (default \"E\" on keyboard). This will cause you to fall much faster than normal, and upon hitting the ground, they create an explosion whose damage and size scale with the distance they fell. The damage and radius ranges from 1000%-10000% & 5m-100m. Afterwards the explosion takes 10 seconds (-50% per stack) to recharge. \nIt will try to automatically lock onto a enemy if one is underneath you while you do this.\nWhile the explosive ability is ready, the H3AD-5T v2 also increases the player's jump height by roughly 400%. \nThis is not done by changing your stats, instead doubling your upward velocity when leaving the ground, which makes it much more influenced by the angle of the floor, and other items.\nAdditionally, the H3AD-5T v2 negates all fall damage taken, regardless of whether the explosive ability is ready or not.\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\nIdle\nWhile idle, the [interact] button must be held down for at least 0.25 seconds before transitioning to the charge state.\nCharge:\nWhile in the charge state, the input must be held for another 0.6 seconds to enter the fall state. Letting go will return back to the idle state. Entering the charge state will decelerate towards 1 m/s vertically at an acceleration of 30.\nLetting go of the input before entering the fall state can be used to extend the distance of some horizontal jumps slightly.\nFall:\nWhile in the fall state, the user will initially fall downwards at 30 m/s, with an acceleration at a rate of 100m/s2 with a max fall speed of 500 m/s.\nThe minimum distance must be greater than the starting position, so the user won't cause the impact while grounded or very close to grounded.\nIf there is an enemy below within 300m, then the user will be slowly moved towards its position while falling.\nImpact\nThe impact has a minimum damage coefficient of 10 (1000%) and a maximum of 100 (10,000%), with a radius scaling from 5m to 100m. To reach maximum damage, the user must fall for 150m.\nThis impact can crit, and knocks enemies back with an outward force of 200 * scalingDamageCoefficient and a vertical force of 2000. This explosion suffers from Sweet Spot falloff.\nThis blast has a proc coefficient of 1.0.\nIf the user somehow loses all stacks of H3AD-5T v2 mid-fall, the impact will not occur.\nThe user's velocity is set to zero on impact.\nAfter impact, it transitions to the cooldown state.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item is highly effective with   Artificer's   Ion Surge, as she can gain as much height as desired before slamming down, maximizing damage.\n  Loader can also make good use of it, by using her grapple and punch to move vertically.\n  Captain can use his   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike to launch himself high into the air, allowing him to slam back down with the H3AD-5T v2. However, he will have very low health afterwards.\nEquipping a  Milky Chrysalis,  Volcanic Egg, or  Eccentric Vase gives the player  vertical mobility.\nDue to the way collisions work in the game, mobility and movement speed items (particularly the  Wax Quail) coincide well with H3AD-5T v2. With sufficient horizontal speed, running and jumping into the bottom of a slope will send the player flying into the air, enabling survivors to gain elevation over enemies.\nWith some finesse,   Mercenary and   Acrid can achieve a similar effect by ricocheting off slopes (Mercenary with   Whirlwind, and Acrid with either   Caustic Leap or   Frenzied Leap).\nThis item combines well with  Runald's Band,  Kjaro's Band and  Singularity Band, as they are activated when the player deals base damage higher than 400%. H3AD-5T v2 always meets this requirement. Moreover, this has the potential to be the second most powerful damage source of the entire game, making it an ideal match for items based on total damage.\nBecause a target is acquired and locked into whenever possible,  Focus Crystal is almost always activated. The stacking of crystals alongside  Delicate Watch,  Armor-Piercing Rounds, and  Crowbar will allow most enemies to be quickly killed.\nThe  Faraday Spur pairs very well with this item as fully charging  Faraday Spur will launch you very high up and get a powerful slam.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe cooldown is determined by the formula f(x)=10/x, with x being the amount of H3AD-5T v2.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Denizens of lower-gravity planets like Mercury historically have had trouble adjusting to life on other planets. Mercurians, with their lower bone density (left) would typically shatter their femur within a week on heavier planets. Members of asteroid-rigged flotillas and colony ships have similar issues when arriving home from space.\n\nThe invention of Kinetic Dispersion Rings (above) help alleviate the stress of heavier-than-normal gravity by converting kinetic energy into heat, sound, and light. Settlers from Mercury could finally leave their home planet in safety.\"\n\n-Mercurian History Museum\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.1.1.4\nBug Fixes\nFixed the landing blast for H3AD-5T v2 not activating from non-host players\nPC Patch v1.1.1.2\nBug Fixes\nFixed   Loader\u2019s   Thunder Slam not working in conjunction with H3AD-ST\nAnniversary Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Now calculates damage from distance traveled, not speed on impact  Developer Notes: Even though this makes less sense from a physics standpoint, it will align better with player expectations.

            "notes": "The Happiest Mask is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. \nWhen the holder kills an enemy, there is a 7% chance that a ghost of that enemy will spawn as an ally, with greatly increased attack strength. The chance for this to happen is affected by Luck.\nThe ghost inherits all behaviors of the original monster. The level of the ghost equals the \"ambient\" level of the run, not the player's level.\nGhosts do not take damage through any normal means; instead, their health drops by a fixed percentage every second. Each ghost normally lasts 30 seconds (+30s per stack), though this can be prolonged if they are healed.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nWhen an entity is killed and resurrected as a ghost, it notably keeps all items it previously had. This means that Elites can be resurrected and keep their Elite status, while with the Artifact of Evolution or on Simulacrum they will also keep any enemy items.\nDespite being on the players' team, the ghosts of   Clay Dunestriders,   Grandparent, and             Void enemies may still harm or kill the player with their life-draining tendrils, solar flare, and void implosions, respectively.\nThe player can damage a ghost via friendly-fire items such as  Helfire Tincture, which may cause them to attempt to attack the player. However, the ghost will not do any damage.\nUnlike drones, ghosts won't travel between stages.\nIf a   Beetle Queen,   Solus Control Unit or the   Alloy Worship Unit becomes a ghost, any   Beetle Guards or   Solus Probes they spawn will not be ghosts, but they will still be allied with the player. This means they can spawn as Elites and will not lose any health over time.\n  Void Infestor ghosts will attempt to infest enemies. If successful, their targets will become {  Voidtouched but remain hostile to the player.\nWhen the Artifact of Vengeance is enabled, the holder can kill and resurrect an Umbra as a friendly ghost.\nLikewise, it is possible for an Umbra that holds the Happiest Mask to kill and resurrect a player as a ghost, which will be hostile towards other players.\nSince the ghost inherits all items, it will also inherit the item that causes Umbras to have special visuals and turn the screen purple. However, on death it will not drop any items, since the death is caused by health degeneration which does not trigger any on kill effects.\nIf the Artifact of Chaos is enabled, it is possible for the holder to kill and resurrect an ally, or even themself, as a ghost.\nIf a ghost falls off the stage, it respawns in bounds instead of dying.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nUse  Gorag's Opus to boost the attack speed and move speed of allied ghosts, making them even stronger.\nKeep an eye on the health of allied Clay Dunestriders, Grandparents, and void monsters. These monsters have powerful attacks that deal friendly-fire damage, which will hurt even more than normal since ghosts' stats are much higher than a normal monster's; however, they can only use these attacks after losing enough health. Clay Dunestriders only use their life-draining tendrils below 25% health, Grandparents only use their solar flare below 50%, and void monsters only use their implosion after dying.\nThis is especially pertinent in   Eclipse mode, since all allies spawn at 50% of their maximum health. This means that Grandparent ghosts will be able to use their solar flare immediately, and Dunestrider and void ghosts will use their dangerous attacks much sooner than normal.\nSince a ghost's lifespan is only limited by time, healing it can give the player a near-permanent and powerful ally. Ghosts can be healed by:\nCollecting  Monster Tooth orbs or   DIRECTIVE: Harvest fruits.\nBeing in the range of  Bustling Fungus,  Interstellar Desk Plant, a Shrine of the Woods,   Captain's   healing beacon, or an allied   Mini Mushrum (likely a ghost itself).\nBeing in the Teleporter radius when a  Lepton Daisy activates.\nIf the ghost had self-healing items before it was resurrected, such as  Medkits or  Leeching Seeds. This can occur in the   Void Fields, while the Artifact of Evolution is enabled, or if the ghost is a   Scavenger.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM RALLYPOINT DELTA --//\n\n\u201cSir, the ghosts are back.\u201d\n\nThe man sighed. After a routine expedition, one of the crew members \u2013 a simple soldier - had recovered an artifact thought to have been aboard the Contact Light \u2013 a simple mask, adorned with a painfully happy grin. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d The man trudged down the hall towards the barracks. The Lemurians he had killed earlier that day walked down the hall by him, barely earning a second glance from the man. This had become so commonplace that most of the crew members in this block had grown accustomed to having a ghostly room-mate.\n\nBut enough was enough. Stepping through the ghost of an Imp, the man slammed the door open. The lights were off, and in the corner sat the soldier.\n\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019ve had enough fun playing with the dead. Fork it over.\u201d\n\nNo response. The man grunted and hoisted the soldier to his feet, giving him a few rough shakes. \u201cHey, can you hear me!? I said hand over the mask! I\u2019m tired of waking up next to Beetles, so give it a rest already--\u201d\n\nThe soldier\u2019s limp body moved. Slowly, the soldier raised his finger \u2013 pointing directly at the man.\n\n\u201cWhat are you...?\u201d With a sense of dread, the man turned and saw the Lemurians he had killed earlier step into the room. Their mouths began to glow with an otherworldly glow.\n\nThe man cursed under his breath as he loaded his shotgun. \u201cThis planet, I tell you...\u201d\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Happiest Mask\nGameplay Changes\nHappiest Mask minions now scale to the 'ambient level' of the run.\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nBug Fixes\nGhosts with curse no longer have shortened lifespans\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nGhost Damage Boost: 300% \u21d2 1500%\nGhost Proc Chance: 10% \u21d2 7%\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nA ghost is actually the original monster with three special hidden items equipped. One makes its health deplete over time; ghosts are awarded 30 of these per Happiest Mask the user has. The second makes it appear and behave like a ghost, so that it is invulnerable to normal damage and becomes transparent. The third boosts its damage; the ghost is supplied 150 of these.\nBecause the time a ghost lasts is tied only to a damage-over-time item it receives, it is possible that   Mini Mushrum ghosts can survive indefinitely because of their healing ability.\nBecause   Captain's   Defensive Microbots passive grants  Defensive Microbots to allies with the \"mechanical\" body tag, if Captain kills and resurrects either   MUL-T,   REX, or   CHEF as a ghost (via either the Artifact of Chaos or Artifact of Vengeance), he will give Defensive Microbots to the ghost.",

            "notes": "N'kuhana's Opinion is an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Her Concepts Challenge.\nAs the holder heals, the item stores 100% (+100% per stack) of the healing as a hidden value, dubbed \"Soul Energy.\" When this value reaches 10% of the holder's maximum health, the player launches a homing skull that deals fixed damage equal to 25% of their maximum health with a proc coefficient of 0.2 within a 40m radius. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe skulls trigger even when healing at full health.\nSkulls are fired one at a time, so a large burst of healing (e.g.  Foreign Fruit) will fire multiple skulls back to back.\nThere is a minimum 0.1 second cooldown between skulls, for a maximum fire rate of 10 skulls per second. This results in a potential maximum DPS of 250% of the holder's max HP per second, assuming consistent healing.\n\"Healing\" implies actively regaining health from a source, where green numbers appear around the player signifying the healed amount; players' passive health regeneration, even when amplified by a  Cautious Slug,  Spinel Tonic, or  Titanic Knurl, will not trigger any skulls to fire.\nAlthough the skulls can trigger on-hit healing effects, such as the  Leeching Seed or  Super Massive Leech, the healing from these items is not added to the Soul Energy value if the triggering hit is a skull.\nShields count as maximum health for the purpose of this item, even if the shields are currently damaged.\nThe Soul Energy value cannot exceed the holder's full combined health (max health plus max shields). Given the item's high rate of fire, this is usually not a problem, however.\nAdditionally, once the player's Soul Energy accumulates enough to activate N'kuhana's Opinion, it will deplete Soul Energy and attempt to fire, even if no enemies are in range. This makes it impossible to stockpile more than one second's worth of attacks, no matter how much healing the player has.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nN'kuhana's Opinion is uniquely one of the only items that does not use the Survivor's damage stat or Total Damage; its damage is directly tied to your combined Max Health and Shields. As the holder's health increases per-level and though items like  Infusion and  Personal Shield Generator , the skulls' damage increases, but so does the healing required to fire each skull.\nFlat healing, such as from  Harvester's Scythe, isn't penalized for this increased health, as the increased damage typically offsets the higher threshold. However, fewer skulls may mean fewer item procs, so it's important to keep any flat healing up to scratch to keep N'kuhana's up to speed (and for the holder to avoid dying, as is typical of any run).\nPercentage-based healing, such as from  Bustling Fungus, grows stronger as the holder's max health increases, as the skulls fire at the same speed and simply deal more damage. However, it's important to remember that N'Kuhana's takes shield into account while these sources do not;  Transcendence would increase the skulls' damage by 50%, but drop the holder's max HP to 1, effectively erasing any percentage-based healing.\n\nN'kuhana's does not benefit from the damage doubling from  Shaped Glass, and the halved HP cuts each skull's damage and required healing in half. As a side effect, flat healing can hit the 10% max HP threshold twice as quickly, while percentage-based healing does not benefit.\n Corpsebloom has some unusual interactions with N'kuhana's. Because it stores all healing and releases it at 10% of the holder's maximum health per second, large bursts of healing will fire one skull per second for an extended period of time. However, this means that the fire rate of those skulls is capped at 1 skull per second (compared to the limit of 10 per second) unless this is bypassed using  Rejuvenation Rack. Generally, Corposebloom is a downgrade if the user can reliably and continuously heal above 10% max health per second.\nUniquely, because Corpsebloom steals and then releases all healing itself, it ignores the restrictions of on-hit healing triggered by skulls. This means a skull can activate on-hit healing, and since Corpsebloom is the item providing the final healing, it will count towards the Soul Energy value where it would normally be filtered out. This means one could theoretically have an infinite loop of consistent, if slow, N'Kahuna's skulls and healing, though this is difficult in practice.\nAlthough the skulls do not use the Damage stat, they can still critically strike and are powered up by the  Focus Crystal,  Crowbar, and  Armor-Piercing Rounds, when applicable.\nThis item can be extremely useful on   Engineer's   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets when combined with Bustling Fungus. The turrets can consistently keep the Bustling Fungus active, since they do not move and are immune to knockback. Additionally, since both of the turrets and Engineer himself receive healing from the fungus and independently fire skulls, placing the turrets such that the healing zones overlap will activate N'kuhana's Opinion very rapidly, dealing high damage at very long range.\n  REX excels with N'kuhana's Opinion, as their entire kit revolves around healing and life-steal. They will be able to activate this item very often.\n  Heretic performs extremely well with this item, since her   Shadowfade skill heals a large portion of her maximum health and her health is much higher than any other Survivor's.\nThe  Rejuvenation Rack pairs exceptionally well with this item, effectively doubling the number of skulls fired.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Let us begin.\n\nWhat is your oath?\n\nNot very long ago, health and time were in perfect synergy. Pain and love. Death and memories. The great equalizer. She would always come for us. \n\nBut! Disparity now plagues our generations - and our children's. Not many pass, but so many are born. So many doomed souls, saved. Our hubris as a race continues to grow - unchecked. Unrestrained. \n\nNow there is no volume in our world for death, and she cannot visit us.

Spin decays over time. Every 1/60th of a second, Spin = previous spin - (1.25 * time since last kill in seconds). In short, spin decays faster the more time passes between kills.\nSpin, in turn, generates charge. Charge does not decay. At 100% charge, the Resonance Disc checks all enemies within the blast radius of its nearest target to see if it can hit more enemies by targeting one of them instead. After selecting a target, it will fire according to the earlier description.\nHow much charge is generated from spin is dependent on time since the last kill, and the current spin used as a vertical velocity with -0.0125  gravity (so upwards).",

            "notes": "Runic Lens is an item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion.\nWhen the holder hits an enemy, there is a 3% chance to summon a meteor on the target which deals 2000% base damage. For every 100% damage dealt by the initial hit, the meteor has a 3% (+3% per stack) higher chance to summon and will deal an extra 150% damage (+50% per stack) if summoned.\nThe meteor has a proc coefficient of 0.5\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item's damage is capped at 7500%.\nAt 1 stack, this cap gets hit by attacks that deal 3700% damage or more.\nAt 2 stack, 2800% damage or more.\nThis item's proc chance is capped at 75%\nAt 1 stack, this cap gets hit by attacks that deal 2400% damage or more.\nAt 2 stack, 1200% damage or more.\nOnly one meteor per player/NPC can exist at the same time.\nAlthough proc chains that proc the meteor cannot trigger it again, the meteor itself does not carry over previous proc chain information. This makes it possible to re-trigger earlier procs in the chain. For example, the meteor and  AtG Missile Mk. 1 can end up in an infinite feedback loop. This is most likely a bug.\nRelatedly, the   SureProc buff bestowed by  Deus Ex Machina is not transferred to a proc chain after a Runic Lens meteor, meaning the meteor isn't guranteed to proc anything. This can cause wildy inconsistent damage output because of the limit of 1 meteor being active at a time.\nThe data about the meteor's target, damage, and impending impact are tied to the attacker's body. If this character's body is destroyed before the meteor lands, there will be no blast. The visual ring surrounding the target and implying the meteor is coming is an independent visual effect which does not trigger the explosion.\nBody destruction in this case is quite literal. When a character is killed, the body object persists for a little longer to perform its death animation, during which time the meteor can still land successfully. However, respawning destroys the old body and creates a new one.\nDespite the meteor visual, only the explosion on impact with the ground deals damage. Therefore, Runic Lens won't be able to damage airborne enemies that are too far from the ground.\n Breaching Fin is an anti-synergy as it will often knock enemies out of the blast area.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nHeavy hitting abilities like   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike, items like  H3AD-5T v2 and equipment like  Royal Capacitor and  Preon Accumulator all have very high damage coefficient, allowing the player to get more value out of Runic Lens by increasing the chances of it proccing and the damage it does.\n  OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike is the only base damage source of damage that can hit the cap on both proc chance and damage,  H3AD-5T v2 being extremely close but falling a little short.\nCrowd control items and skills such as  Sentient Meat Hook,  Primordial Cube, and   Beacon: Shocking all increase the value of Runic Lens by allowing it to hit tons of enemies at once.\n\n\n== Math ==\nNote: After update 1.3.6, Overspill is no longer mentioned in the Runic Lens' in-game description. This section may be outdated.\nThe definition of Overspill is\noverspill=\u230atotalDamage/baseDamage\u230b\nThis is used to calculate the chance of proccing the item\nchance=min(5+overspill\u00d7stacks,50)\nWhen the roll is successful, the meteor summoned deals damage equal to\ndamage=min(20+0.5\u00d7overspill\u00d7stacks,75)\nThis value is calculated in terms of base damage multiples, i.e., at most it will do 7500% of base damage.\nThe average damage done by this attack is simply chance\u00d7damage.\nThe following table shows how much damage the meteor will deal on average for various Overspill and item stack values. This assumes no luck. To see instead how much an instance of damage a meteor will deal whenever procced, one has to only take into account the damage formula from above.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: \"Insurance Nightmare\"\nEstimated Delivery: 06/28/2027\nShipping method: High Priority\n\nShipping Address: Merchants Guild, Neon Nexus, Mercury\nShipping details:\n\nAppraisal complete.\nFull report and certificate of Kosthenticity attached.\n\nIf its user starts a fight, this wretched thing will certainly finish it.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nDon\u2019t touch the pale yellow runes, ever, for any reason.\nDon\u2019t sleep near it.\nDon\u2019t make eye contact with it.\nDon\u2019t use it indoors.\n\nI\u2019ve included the bill for my roof.\n\n- Kosta of Crumbling Tower\n\n\n== Version History ==\nUpdate Notes V1.3.6\nOld Functionality - Overspill. 5% chance (+1% per 100% done on initial hit plus 1% per item stack) on hit to summon a meteor on the target, dealing 2000% damage (+50% damage per 100% damage done on initial hit plus +50% damage per item stack).\nNew Functionality - 3% chance on hit to call a meteor strike, dealing 2000% base damage.

The only drawback to this is the number of enemies it can hook, but this is rarely an issue.\nTo get an even higher chance, you can get more meat hooks along with clovers.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"When artificial intelligence became more commonplace, many companies jumped on the trend for \"smart\" products.

            "notes": "Shattering Justice is a returning item introduced in the Skills 2.0 Update.\nUpon hitting an enemy 5 times, that enemy receives the   Pulverized debuff for 8 seconds (+8 seconds per stack), which reduces their armor by 60 points. Since most enemies don't have any or have very little armor, this item usually sets their armor to a negative value.\nThe build-up effect, a stacking debuff known as   Pulverize Buildup, lasts for 2 seconds, multiplied by the proc coefficient of the hit. Once Pulverize Buildup has stacked 5 times, all buildup stacks are removed, Pulverized is applied, and that enemy cannot receive more buildup debuffs. Because the duration of the build-up is affected by the proc coefficient, damage-over-time effects like the  Tri-Tip Dagger do not put any build-up on enemies.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item can be seen as a mostly consistent damage buff for almost all characters, as the way the game calculates damage through armor also accounts for negative armor and greatly increases damage accordingly. The value is approximately 38% more damage for normal monsters and about 55% more for average bosses (depending on their armor).\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Shattering Justice pairs well with the  Death Mark, since Pulverized and Pulverize Buildup both count towards getting even more bonus damage from the Death Mark.\nNote that Pulverized and Pulverize Buildup are mutually exclusive, so an enemy cannot be afflicted with both at once.\nIn multiplayer, it is wise to give this item to the player with the highest attack speed whenever it appears, as the debuff is applied after 5 hits from any ability regardless of its damage. This means Shattering Justice is best on   Commando with   Phase Blast or   Captain, as the 8 shots fired by both will instantly cause an enemy to be affected by the debuff, allowing the rest of the team to focus on the afflicted monster for serious damage.\nConversely, this item is weaker on   Loader, since her slow base attack speed combined with her focus on her utility skill makes it difficult to apply the debuff without going out of her way to apply extra hits.\nA critical hit from   Huntress with   Flurry can also apply the debuff, since it fires 6 projectiles.\nAny attack from   Captain's   Vulcan Shotgun that lands at least five bullets will also instantly apply the debuff.\n  Bandit using   Burst can instantly activate the debuff if all five bullets hit.\n  MUL-T with   Auto-Nailgun can rapidly reach 5 stacks of buildup, especially when using   Power Mode. However, this is somewhat less effective against long-range targets due to damage falloff.\n  Power-Saw can also build up 5 stacks easily, but only against nearby targets.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nShattering Justice Owner\u2019s Manual\n\nExcerpt from section 2.13:\n\n... and if the target material doesn\u2019t cave under the immense weight just keep hitting it until it does. The patented technology inside the face of this tool doesn\u2019t just use brute force to break down its mark, it also utilizes a formulated nano toxin, released through internal mechanisms, that builds up through subsequent contact.

This also means equipment that were previously useless for Equipment Drones, like the  Ocular HUD, may have newfound purpose.\nIf the Equipment Drone has a Goobo Jr., the Gummy Equipment Drones spawned will also be affected by the Spare Drone Parts.

This can be observed when the   final boss steals the item in his final phase and it is later returned to the player.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nBe advised that when Mithrix steals this item during his fourth phase, he will not gain a Col. Droneman himself but will leave the player's droneman defenseless by removing all bonuses to any drones the player has. (Col. Droneman does not actually have any attacks and its only source of damage is the generic chaingun that every drone gets when holding this item)\nWhen the item is returned, the player will obtain a second Col. Droneman and both drones will obtain the chaingun as well (assuming the first one survives until then).\nThis item augments damage drones, while providing healing and utility drones an attack to contribute in offensive ways.\nThis item synergizes well with a   Captain drone build. While   his passive provides defensive measures against most monsters, the Spare Drone Parts allows drone minions to deal considerably more damage.\nAlthough it is tempting to gather as many drones as possible, keep in mind the ally limit of 15; past this point, allies cannot be spawned by items or equipment (e.g. the Empathy Cores or The Back-up). If too many small drones or non-drone allies are on the team, these more powerful drone allies cannot be summoned once destroyed, lowering the team's damage output. This may not be much of an issue, however, since the weaponry provided by the Spare Drone Parts is so powerful to begin with.\n\n\n== Lore - Item ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"Y'see those new drone models they approved for us?

Commonly known as 'the bloodiest conflict in human history', the tides of the War of 2019 were completely changed by escalating drone technologies, entirely replacing allied boots-on-the-ground deployments with machines-in-the-air by the end of the war. \n\nThe TCX-55, known by those with whom he served as \"Colonel Droneman\", as well as other similar less-noteworthy prototypes, were significant for their ability to interface with and parallel compute for other drones in use by UES-affiliated militaries, allowing for a significant increase in firepower per drone, with a TCX unit handling their targeting and routing routines.\n\nColonel Droneman is highly regarded for its extraordinary character and integrity as well as its unique vision on leadership and combat tactics. Having conducted over 90 operations against Aeonian frontlines and strongholds, Drones under operation of Colonel Droneman were highly feared by enemy forces, deploying previously unseen tactics whilst evading fire and dispatching enemies - many modern principles of drone combat, such as sticking near walls to avoid detection, or keeping distance from vulnerable targets for an opportune time to strike, have been derived from the ingenious strategies first deployed by the Colonel.\n\nColonel Droneman is still proudly in UES service as of [2056], and was currently last in-use by [Deimos military] in [the Boron System].\"\n\n-Exhibit at The National WW19 Museum\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.2.0\n Spare Drone Parts no longer grants Col.

With enough stacks of this item's debuff, these monsters' additional armor can be negated, allowing them to take significantly more damage than normal in these circumstances.\nAlthough the effects of Symbiotic Scorpion and  Shattering Justice are similar, which one is more effective for a given player will depend on their survivor and build. Those focused on stacking up proc effects in order to steadily whittle enemies down would be better off with the Scorpion, whereas those with a focus on heavy hits and burst damage might prefer  Shattering Justice.\nThis item can be incredibly dangerous if discovered by a   Scavenger, stolen by   Mithrix, or given to the monsters on the final stage of the   Void Fields, as practically every hit the Survivors take from the holder(s) will increase the damage they'll take from all attacks for the full remainder of the stage.\nSimilar precautions should be taken when playing with Artifact of Chaos, Artifact of Vengeance, and/or Artifact of Evolution. Chaos and Vengeance can make it dangerous for the players to pick up Symbiotic Scorpion, and Evolution could give one or more to all enemies the player(s) might encounter.\nDespite being a debuff, Symbiotic Scorpion's armor reduction is not removed by the effects of  Blast Shower.\n Ben's Raincoat prevents the accumulation of   Permanent Armor Reduction stacks, but will not remove stacks that were in place prior to its collection.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"There's countless ways to defeat your enemy.

Since shields cannot heal through normal means, this can be an unwanted nuisance for players who are in the fray often and require that healing to stay alive.\nHowever, getting the Overloading buff will also instantly grant 50% shield, even if the holder's current health is below 50% of its max. Similarly, getting the Perfected buff will turn the holder's health into shield and immediately grant 100% shield. In either case, when the effect ends, the holder is also healed for the amount of health originally turned into shields: 50% for Overloading and 100% for Perfected (regardless of how much or little shield the player had right before the effect expired). The  Rejuvenation Rack increases this post-buff restoration, but items like  Corpsebloom and  N'kuhana's Opinion are not affected.\nThere is a bug involving this item and  Safer Spaces, which allows the shield to recharge instantly. This happens when a character kills a {  Voidtouched enemy and the elite buff expires while Safer Spaces is still on {  on cooldown. This is because when the elite buff expires it removes a stack of the cooldown debuff and when the timed debuff expires, it removes another stack, bringing the total number of stacks to -1. When that character is then hit and loses the {  shield, it will add one stack for the cooldown debuff, but since it will only be at 0 stacks and therefore \"not present\", the shields will be enabled on the next frame. When the cooldown debuff later expires, it will bring the debuff stacks to -1, conserving the corrupted state.\nThere is a secondary bug involved here, where the shields behavior is not granted/removed when the character gains/loses the Voidtouched elite buff, but when there is a change in the character's inventory and it makes a check for the elite buff's existence. Therefore, the Safer Spaces shields must be on cooldown while the elite buff shields behavior is removed and not when the elite buff technically expires. Other than adding/removing/transforming an item in the character's inventory, an inventory change check can also be triggered when the character picks up an  Infusion orb. As such, the easiest way to trigger the bug is to hold Wake of Vultures, Safer Spaces, and Infusion. Note that holding an Infusion is an insufficient condition when the character has reached the max bonus health for the currently held stacks and the inventory change needs to be triggered by another method.\nThis bug fixes itself when the character is revived, or advances to the next stage as all buffs are reset.\nEven though the character is impervious to most sources of damage, the shield technically goes on cooldown until the next frame, so if the character is hit by multiple sources of damage in the same frame, only the first one will be protected from the shields, while the rest will go through.\nA different way to trigger this same bug is to have the   final boss steal  Safer Spaces while it is on cooldown. When the player retrieves the item, they will gain the same instant recharge behaviour for the rest of the stage.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Unique Leather Belt\n\nTracking Number: 40***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 10/23/2056\n\nShipping Method:  High Priority / Biological\n\nShipping Address: Auckland, New Zealand, Earth\n\nShipping Details: \n\n\u201cThe mind rules over its body from a fortress of bone, learning of the world around it through fleshy portals.

Similarly to  Queen's Gland, these minions have stronger stats than their regular counterparts, with 4 times the health and a damage stat that increases by 100% (+100% per stack) per ally on the team, including each other but not their owner, starting their damage at 2x if all of them are alive. The Solus Probes are re-summoned every 30 seconds if they are destroyed and they only take 25% of damage dealt by AoE attacks due to a hidden +300 armor bonus against them. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nAllies include drones and turrets, other players, and minions spawned by items like  Queen's Gland, as well as ghosts spawned by  Happiest Mask. Essentially, every entity that appears on the column on the left side of the HUD.\nIf the Artifact of Swarms is active, four Probes will spawn instead of two, augmenting their damage output.\nThe Empathy Cores is one of the few blacklisted items that   Engineer's turrets will not inherit.\nWhen the   final boss steals the player's items, he will gain his own Probes and they will attack the player, dealing high damage.\nThis becomes even more dangerous if he steals multiple Empathy Cores or Queen's Glands, as the Probes will become extremely powerful.\n  Loader's   Spiked Fist can pull the Probes to her, although this will not damage them.\nThe Probes have collision, allowing players to stand on them. However, it may be difficult to remain there given how they move around when enemies are near.\nThe Probes will not respawn once the player has hit the ally limit of 16, making 14 allies the maximum amount that can be active at a time to ensure that the Probes can always be active. Acquiring yet another ally once the limit is reached (such as summoning a friendly   Aurelionite with a  Halcyon Seed) will not cause the Probes to despawn; however, if one of them dies then it will not respawn until the player has 15 or fewer allies again.\n Spare Drone Parts: Despite the probes not visually obtaining any augmentations, they will gain all of the buffs and chaingun granted by this item, and since   Col. Droneman is another ally, the damage it deals will get boosted as well.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n13006; PROBE CORE INSTANCE REQUEST RECOGNIZED\n\n13006; PROBE CORE INSTANCE OVERVIEW FOR STORED MODELS:\n\n;SER ID> 04534098130\n\n;INST> MINING PROBE INSTANCES\n\n;HIGHLIGHTS\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY BOLD AND GREEN AND LONELY\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY DEAD AND YELLOW\n\n> THIS ONE IS VERY COLD AND RED AND LONELY\n\n13010; DOCKING CORES\n\n13011; DEPLOYED\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Boss Item: Empathy Cores\nAdded New Lore Entry: Empathy Cores\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nDespite using   Solus Probe's icon in-game (Wiki's icon is from WolfoQOL), each Probe has a unique design.\nThis item's name and the \"personalities\" of the Probes it summons (\"Quiet\" and \"Delighted\") may be a reference to the Personality Cores from the Portal series.\nThe colors of the Probes resemble that of The Twins boss from the game Terraria, a pair of colossal mechanical eyes that are also red and green.\nThe Probes are wrapped in cloth similar to that worn by the   Heretic, suggesting a possible link between the two.\nThis is especially intriguing given the Heretic's strong resemblance to an   Alloy Vulture, and the Alloy Vultures' relationship with the   Alloy Worship Unit.",

            "notes": "The Genesis Loop is a boss item introduced in the Hidden Realms Update, dropped by the   Wandering Vagrant.\nIf the holder falls to 25% of their max health or less, they create a 100m explosion that inflicts 6000% damage on any enemies in the vicinity, similar to the Vagrants' signature supernova attack. This explosion has a short charging period, which decreases with increased attack speed.\nThe player can only explode once every 15 seconds, though this cooldown period is reduced by having more Genesis Loops. If the player happens to still be below 25% health when this cooldown is finished, they will immediately prepare to explode again, even if they have not taken damage recently.\nThe explosion has a proc coefficient of 1.0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of 30s (-50% per stack) is incorrect.\nThe Survivor's model will visibly crackle with electricity when the Genesis Loop is fully charged.\nThe 25% HP threshold is calculated using maximum HP plus maximum shield. For instance, if the player has 750 max HP and 250 max shield, the Genesis Loop will trigger when they reach 250 HP.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nWhile the explosion is charging, the player should try to find the best place to explode and damage the most possible enemies.\nThe  Old War Stealthkit makes this easier, since both items are triggered by taking extensive damage and the Stealthkit grants increased movement speed.\n  Engineer makes excellent use of this item, as his turrets are expendable enough to reliably trigger the explosion without putting Engineer himself in peril.\n  REX's self-damaging abilities make activating the Genesis Loop much easier, and since they can rapidly recover health they can recover from peril safely.\nBy paying the second or third offering at a Shrine of Blood, the player can take a fixed amount of damage and explode on demand, without needing to risk taking damage from enemies.\nBy obtaining 38 stacks of  Personal Shield Generator, and making sure their shield never regenerates, the player can stay permanently below the detonation threshold, though this many stacks of Personal Shield Generator may be difficult to obtain in a normal run.\nThe  Power Elixir triggers simultaneously with the Genesis Loop and does not prevent the explosion from going off, healing the player immediately once they reach the threshold to activate the Genesis Loop. This makes it considerably safer to activate, although this is limited by how many Power Elixirs the player has.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe cooldown is determined by the formula 30 / (amount + 1)\n\nThe full time between blasts is determined by the formula 30 / (amount + 1) + 3 / attackSpeed + 2\n\n30 / (amount + 1) is the recharge time, after detonation.\n3 / attackSpeed is the charge time, after the Genesis Loop activates but before detonation.\n2 is the detonation duration.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nLab Dissection Analysis File\n\nSubject: Genesis Loop\n\nTechnician: Eleanor Veirs\n\nTable Spec: Dissection 5B4 with Ele-Maintenance Kit\n\nNotes: \n\n> Genesis Loop is highly conductive organ, contains conductive filaments stretching from one end to the other\n\n> Both sides of loop have organelles at end; one has positive charge, one has negative charge\n\n> Sticking ends of loop together generates voltage\n\n> Connected loop and fed organ 50 volts\n\n> Hair stood up on end, touching loop resulting in numbness in fingers\n\n> Upping voltage to 100 volts\n\n> Shooting arcs from organ, loop shudders and glows bright, dissonant humming is heard\n\n> Upping voltage to 200 volts\n\n> Bright flash, a loud crack as loop releases a blast that knocks me back\n\n> Lights go out\n\n> Dissection Table hardware damaged by voltage\n\n> I hope I don\u2019t get in trouble for this\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Genesis Loop\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nBug Fixes\nFix Genesis Loop area indicator being half the actual size of the blast\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Boss Item: Genesis Loop\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Genesis Loop is the successor to the Nematocyst Nozzle from Risk of Rain 1, the Wandering Vagrant's boss item in that game.\nUniquely, this boss item was an equipment instead of a regular item.

The player will retrieve their Halcyon Seed when Aurelionite dies (regardless of whether she died at the end of the Teleporter Event or was killed in some other way). In multiplayer, players who die after Aurelionite is summoned will still recover their Halcyon Seeds when Aurelionite dies.\nThis item stacks based on the total amount held by all players combined (items held by   Engineer's   turrets do not count), similarly to the Lepton Daisy. Each Halcyon Seed beyond the first gives Aurelionite an additional 100% health and some extra damage.\nIf the player is fighting   Mithrix and is in phase 4, Aurelionite will spawn and help the player.\nIf the player is fighting the   False Son and is in phase 3, Aurelionite will spawn and fight against the player while keeping the increased stats from any excess stacks of Halcyon Seed. Defeating False Son in this way clears the Purified Freedom challenge and unlocks the   False Son as a playable survivor.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: While Aurelionite's Health increases by 100% per stack of Halcyon Seed, Aurelionite's Damage is actually equal to the square root of the number of stacks of Halcyon Seed rounded to the nearest 10%\n\nThe Halcyon Seed is one of the few blacklisted items that   Engineer's turrets will not inherit.\nIf theArtifact of Command is active when Aurelionite is defeated at Gilded Coast, a Yellow Command Essence will drop, but it will only allow this item to be selected.\nIf the Artifact of Swarms is active, two Aurelionites with half the normal health will spawn at Gilded Coast. However, only one Aurelionite will spawn during Teleporter Events.\nIf the player damages an allied Aurelionite via items such as  Helfire Tincture, she may attempt to attack them. However, she will not do any damage.\nThe   final boss has special dialogue if any Halcyon Seeds are brought to the fight. Upon seeing Aurelionite, he exclaims \"THE GUARDIAN...? IMPOSSIBLE...!\" or \"THE WRETCHED GUARDIAN!\" If he manages to defeat Aurelionite, he states either \"YOU CANNOT DEFY ME, GUARDIAN,\" or \"RETURN TO DIRT, GUARDIAN.\"\nThe   final boss also has a unique dialogue if the   Heretic has the Halcyon Seed: \"THE HERETIC\u2026 THE GUARDIAN\u2026 HOW? WHO PULLS YOUR STRINGS, VERMIN?\"\nWhen Aurelionite dies while allied with the player, she has a chance of dropping Aurelionite's Log.\nAurelionite can become   Voidtouched by a   Void Infestor, which causes her to attack players. This can become a serious problem during Teleporter Events if any Void Infestors are near.\nBe wary of attacking   Void Reavers that may be near Aurelionite, as she will make no attempt to avoid their death implosion and will be instantly killed.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nBrother, what is this...?

Its common counterpart is the  Pearl, which only increases the holder's health.\nWhen combined with both the scarcity of Cleansing Pools and the general unlikelihood of players having mass amounts of lunar items to trade, the Irradiant Pearl becomes one of the rarest items, if not the rarest item, in the game.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe  Recycler cannot be used to transform other boss items into an Irradiant Pearl, or vice versa.\nThough a Shrine of Order can be used to fulfill the same purpose.\nIrradiant Pearls cannot be obtained while the Artifact of Command is active.

However, when the player enters the Celestial Portal to enter A Moment, Fractured and obliterates themself at the Obelisk, they will be transported to A Moment, Whole before ending the run. This secret area contains one of the four   Twisted Scavengers, each of which have their own preset list of items and equipment unlike regular   Scavengers.\nStacking the Beads beyond the first pickup has no additional effect.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nSince most Lunar items have an effect that is severely detrimental to the player, the Beads of Fealty provide players with an item to convert with a Cleansing Pool without risk.\nDying to the   Twisted Scavenger after obliterating will not grant mastery skins.\nBeads of Fealty cannot be obtained in either the Eclipse or Simulacrum game modes, as A Moment, Fractured is inaccessible in both.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThe master of this world is a benevolent protector.

It is not long after they are found that Providence, the mighty protector, appears in a thunderous instant to pursue their owner and solemnly take a life he swore to defend.\n\nIt is no physical property of the beads themselves which provoke such a drastic response - but instead, what they represent. They are a symbol, and to carry them is a dark promise to undo the world \u2013 to cast to oblivion all people who find their final place here, all in exchange for a doomed return to ruinous way. The elusive, sinister intelligence with whom these beads represent a pact seems known only to the bearer - and to Providence himself.\n\nOne thing, however, is known to anyone who has borne witness to these beads: a cruel, cackling laughter that erupts as blood and coins of favor are spilled, abruptly silenced as the beads are destroyed.

            "notes": "The Brittle Crown is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2. \nThe player has a 30% chance to gain gold equal to 8%(+8% per stack) of the Small Chest any time they hit an enemy, but they will surrender a percentage of their gold to any enemy that deals damage to them. The proportion of gold surrendered is equal to the proportion of maximum health lost (+100% per stack). Self-inflicted damage, such as from the  Helfire Tincture, will subtract the holder's gold accordingly but return it shortly after.\nThe chance to gain gold when damaging enemies is affected by the proc coefficient. The amount of gold gained is also affected by the difficulty coefficient.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Engineer's turrets are affected by the Brittle Crown, but they gain and lose gold independently from the player. Since the turrets cannot use gold in any way, this makes the Brittle Crown effectively useless for them.\n The Crowdfunder becomes self-sustaining with a Brittle Crown, as long as the player can continually hit enemies with it and avoid taking damage.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe formula for gold earned is: C \u22c5 D \u22c5 2\nC = Number of Brittle Crowns\nD = Difficulty Coefficient\n\n\n=== Shrine of Blood ===\nThe Brittle Crown has a unique interaction with the Shrine of Blood. This is no longer the case after Survivors of the Void, which changed the Brittle Crown's gold loss.\n\nThe amount of gold earned is not added to the total amount of gold when calculating gold lost.\nIf the player has 100 health, 100 gold, and one Brittle Crown, using the Shrine of Blood for the first time will leave them with 75 gold.\nTaking 50% damage, they lose 50% of their gold, leaving them with 50 gold. The shrine always gives 50% of the health taken as gold, so they then gain 25 gold.\nThe Brittle Crown subtracts gold based on the player's fullCombinedHealth, which is their maximum HP plus their maximum shields. This is the same value that Shrines of Blood use, so as long as the player's fullCombinedHealth is more than two times their current gold, using a Shrine of Blood for the first time will net a profit.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nA wretched carnival.\n\nThey were doomed for good reason.

Creatures without restraint. Each and every one, planet killers. And yet, you entertain them as guests. Like children, requiring saving and protection.\n\nShe should have died for me. Her gift was wasted on you.\n\nAnd when will we open discussion - dear brother - of all your thin lies? Why do you forbid your guests to leave? To pilot? Why do you fashion great walls and gates? Why do you weave constructs of destruction, if your role is protection? They are entries in your collection. You slaver. Gatekeeper. Hoarder.\n\nYour death is fated. When you die - and you WILL die - I will be ready. I have been patient for millennia. That planet... is mine.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe logbook entry for the Brittle Crown is written from   Mithrix's perspective and references the various species on   Petrichor V and the tragedies that Providence, the main antagonist of the first Risk of Rain, rescued them from.\nIntriguingly, this item and its logbook entry were added to the game before Mithrix was added as a boss.\nSince the gold reward for killing monsters is tied to their amount of gold they are currently holding, if a monster gets access to this item, the gold reward can increase or decrease based on how much they hit the player or get hit respectively. This is only possible when the player has any stacks of  Eulogy Zero and it is a scenario where monsters can gain items for them to be converted to a Brittle Crown, i.e., Artifact of Evolution,   Void Fields, or Simulacrum.\nThe  Roll of Pennies is blacklisted for monsters, but if it were possible to give it to them, they would reward the player with more gold than naturally expected.\nA   Scavenger spawning with  The Crowdfunder is another way to have a monster's gold amount altered, albeit specific to that entity.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nRemove flat gold reduction on Brittle Crown\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Lore Entry: Brittle Crown\nGameplay Changes\nUpdate Brittle Crown\u2019s item log description to now show stacking behavior",

            "notes": "The Corpsebloom is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2.\nAll the player's healing is increased by 100% (+100% per stack), but unlike the  Rejuvenation Rack, regeneration is not increased. Additionally, all healing is applied over time; whenever the player would heal, it is instead stored in the Corpsebloom. Every 0.2 seconds, the Corpsebloom takes from this store and heals the holder up to 2% of their maximum health (up to 10% per second). This healing cap is halved per additional stack. \nThe healing increase scales linearly, while the amount of maximum health that can be healed scales hyperbolically.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe holder can only store up to 100% of their maximum health as healing.\nThe  Rejuvenation Rack affects the Corpsebloom twice: it increases the healing when it is stored, and increases it again when the healing is actually applied. Additionally, the Rack's second healing increase is applied after the Corpsebloom caps the healing over time, meaning that the Rack also increases the maximum amount of health that can be recovered per second. For instance, with a single Corpsebloom and Rejuvenation Rack, the player receives 8 times as much healing and can recover a maximum of 20% of their health per second.\nAssuming the player has at least 1 Corpsebloom, the full formula for how much healing the player receives is DirectHealing \u22c5 (Corpseblooms + 1) \u22c5 (RejuvenationRacks +1)^2\n\n\n== Tips ==\nWhether or not to pick up the Corpsebloom basically depends on how much healing the player currently has; if they cannot heal at least 10% of their max health per second, then the Corpsebloom is almost entirely beneficial. If their healing exceeds the cap, or they have large bursts of healing (e.g. from the  Foreign Fruit), then the Corpsebloom will likely be detrimental.\nAs a result, the Corpsebloom is generally more effective on short runs e.g. going for Mithrix without looping, and typically falls off in effectiveness on long runs, as enemies deal much more damage and thus the player must heal much more.\n  REX suffers a delay on healing from all abilities while holding Corpsebloom.\nWhile holding a  Planula and a Corpsebloom, the user heals 30 HP upon taking damage. The Planula is unlikely to exceed the Corpsebloom's healing cap.\n  Shadowfade heals 18.2% of the user's max health total over 3 seconds. While holding  Strides of Heresy and one Corpsebloom,   Shadowfade heals 30% of max health while intangible and the remaining 6.4% of max health 1 second later.\nStand still while holding Bustling Fungus to store healing quickly. This can be useful during waiting periods or between waves of various battles.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe maximum healing per second is determined by the formula 0.1 \u22c5 1/(amount)\n\n\n== Lore ==\n========================================\n\n====   MyBabel Machine Translator   ====\n\n====     [Version 12.45.1.009 ]   ======\n\n========================================\n\nTraining\u2026 <100000000 cycles>\n\nTraining\u2026 <253421 cycles>\n\nComplete!\n\nDisplay result?

The chance for this to happen would be determined by critstat/corpseblooms, and the player's chance to deal critical damage would be lowered by this amount. This was abandoned before the Early Access release because \"[crit heal] wasn't as cool as it sounded\". The Corpsebloom still has the internal name 'CritHeal' as a relic from this early development stage. This is not to be confused with 'HealOnCrit', which would be the  Harvester's Scythe.\nSimilarly to how the Rejuvenation Rack affects the Corpsebloom's healing, the effect of   Eclipse 5 reduces healing twice when calculating the heal for Corpsebloom. This makes even a single Corpsebloom a useless item to pick up on Eclipse 5 and higher.\nIn the RoR2 Discord poll of June 10th 2019, the Corpsebloom was voted the least favorite lunar item.\n\n\n== References ==",

Shrines that can be activated multiple times will spawn enemies for each activation.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nStacking this item will cause the summoned enemies to be more powerful and/or numerous, as though the difficulty were higher. This also means that those enemies are worth more gold and EXP when they die.\nIf playing with the Artifact of Sacrifice, this item can be used to acquire items more easily, as higher difficulty enemies also have higher chances to drop items. However this strategy is inherently limited by the amount of shrines one can find in any given stage.\nJust like Shrines of Combat, the difficulty scaling of the enemies spawned by this item is based on the difficulty when the player enters the level, not when the shrine is activated.\nBe careful when trying to get rid of this item through a Cleansing Pool while having multiple stacks or multiple lunar items, as every use that doesn't entirely remove this item will spawn enemies. This scenario can be particularly problematic if the stage happens to feature a Family Event, especially the             Void Family Event.\nThe Defiant Gouge will stop working after the difficulty gets too high per amount of item, similar to Shrines of Combat, because of the extreme cost of each enemy that needs to be spawned.

The artist felt only rage, rage at the laborer who had defiled his masterpiece, and rage at the common folk who lauded the laborer as a hero.\n\nAnd just as the laborer did not recognize the beauty of the untouched statue, so too did the laborer fail to recognize the shards of marble constricting around his leg.\u201d\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Defiant Gouge\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27 Monster Spawn Points: 100 (+100 per stack) \u21d2 40 (+40 per stack)  Developer Notes: A single Gouge would spawn way too many monsters.

            "notes": "Egocentrism is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nEvery 3 seconds (-50% per stack), this item generates a floating orb around the holder, up to a maximum of 3 (+1 per stack). When an orb gets close to an enemy, it rapidly homes in on it, exploding on contact for 360% damage. \nEvery 60 seconds, the holder will lose one random item and gain a stack of Egocentrism. The item lost is random and can come from any rarity, including other lunar items. This timer does not change with increasing stacks of Egocentrism.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of 3s (-50% per stack) per orb is incorrect. The actual time to summon each orb is 3/stacksseconds per orb.\nSince only 1 orb can be summoned per frame, this makes 60 Egocentrisms the effective limit for damage per second, at 21,600% per second. However, additional stacks beyond this still enable the player to have a larger quantity of orbs at once, giving increased burst damage at the start of an encounter.\nAfter reaching the 15th Egocentrism, bombs will be generated further away from the Survivor, forming multiple progressively larger orbits of bombs.\nThe Survivor's head is replaced with a large glowing sphere.\nEgocentrism will not convert any untiered items, such as the  Empty Bottle,  Delicate Watch (Broken), and even  Tonic Afflictions.\nItems are chosen randomly regardless of number of stacks, rarity, or how recently they were picked up; an item with 30 stacks is just as likely to have one of them assimilated as an item with only 2 stacks.\nThe orbs ignore terrain completely, both when orbiting the holder and when attacking enemies.\nWhen holding a  Brilliant Behemoth, the orbs will trigger the Behemoth's explosion on contact with terrain.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nBecause Egocentrism will eventually consume all other items, it makes having a good equipment even more important than usual. Equipment with short cooldowns work best, such as the  Gnarled Woodsprite for consistent extra healing or  The Crowdfunder or  Royal Capacitor for long-range damage.\nIf the player has multiple equipment charges from  Fuel Cells, the extra charges remain even after the Fuel Cells are lost. However, after those charges are used up the player will need to find more Fuel Cells in order to store extra charges again.\nThe bombs' short range (and the item-consuming nature of Egocentrism) makes it difficult to use for Survivors who lack innate mobility skills, since movement-related items are always in danger of being lost.\nIronically, the bombs themselves can also provide range with enough stacks of Egocentrism. While this can still result in a loss of movement items, this can offset the range downside.\nEgocentrism works best on survivable short-range Survivors such as   Mercenary,   Loader,   False Son, and   Drifter. It can also work well for   Void Fiend because of its innate ability to heal itself, even without any items.\n  Engineer's turrets inherit his Egocentrisms and have a slightly higher base damage stat than him. Egocentrism makes each turret type even better at its role:   TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets can eliminate nearby foes and defend an area even better, while the  TR58 Carbonizer Turrets charge straight towards enemies and relentlessly attack, making their offense even more dangerous.\nAvoid Egocentrism when playing as the   Heretic, as losing any Heresy item will leave her with the useless   Nevermore skill in its place. This is especially dangerous when losing the  Strides of Heresy, removing Heretic's only innate way to recover her degenerating health.\nThis item makes getting the logbook entries for the  Pearl and  Irradiant Pearl much easier, although it is still time-consuming. By having at least 1 other item, the player can find a Cleansing Pool and complete that stage's Teleporter Event so that no enemies spawn, then repeatedly use the Cleansing Pool while they have at least 1 Egocentrism. If no Irradiant Pearls are found, they simply wait until the Egocentrism converts all the Pearls back into Egocentrism, and repeat.\nEgocentrism assimilates items even while the timer is frozen in Hidden Realms. This means the player can simply idle to gain more Egocentrism for later use (either for Cleansing Pools or for fighting), without worrying about scaling difficulty.\nEgocentrism provides the only way to remove non-consumable Void Items from the player's inventory, aside from using the Shrine of Order. This can be helpful in case the player accidentally picks up a void item that corrupts items important to their build, or if they simply no longer want the items. However, this is highly imprecise, and Egocentrism will very likely damage the player's build itself.\nThis strategy is more useful on a stage with a Cleansing Pool, as the player can convert all of the Egocentrisms into   Pearls and  Irradiant Pearls, providing increases to their stats and preventing Egocentrism from consuming any more items.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n...I know you can hear me.\n\nI was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, at first.

            "notes": "Eulogy Zero is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nWhen entering a new stage, there is a 5% (+5% per stack) chance for each item generated in the stage to be replaced with a random lunar item instead. This affects items in Chests, 3D Printers, Void Cradles, Void Potential Orbs, Rusted/Encrusted Lockboxes, the Teleporter reward, and the Cauldrons in the   Bazaar Between Time. It also affects any item dropped while the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled, and the item dropped when using the  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn. However, it does not affect Elite equipment drops.\nEulogy Zero also affects items given to monsters. This applies to the items   Scavengers spawn with, the items given to monsters from the Artifact of Evolution, and the items monsters gain in the   Void Fields and Simulacrum.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nEulogy Zero is a completely global effect. Any loot source that can be replaced will have the chance, regardless if the player who caused the item to drop has Eulogy or not.\nAs it is a global effect, it cannot be luck affected.\nItems in chests are replaced when the stage is generated.\nThis means that, if picking up Eulogy Zero mid-stage from e.g. a Lunar Pod, it will not take effect until the next stage's loot is generated.\nA 3D Printer that is affected by Eulogy Zero will print the displayed lunar item, but the rarity of the input item will be as though the printer was unaffected. For instance, a 3D Printer that printed white items but was affected will print 1 white item into the displayed lunar item.\nEulogy Zero can cause Scavengers to spawn with lunar items, but it does not affect their scavenging skill that gives them additional items; no matter how many Eulogy Zero the player team has, a Scavenger can never pick up a lunar item after it spawns.\nThe loot options generated by a Void Potential roll indepedently for replacement.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nEulogy Zero cannot replace certain drops, such as  Artifact Keys and every source of temporary items.\nThe items dropped after opening a Scavenger's sack cannot be replaced.\nBe wary that  Prison Matrix can be replaced, despite also being a quest item.\nEulogy Zero does not care about the required or banned item tags of the drop table it is replacing. As such, you could get  Shaped Glass from a Healing Chest, or get AIBlacklisted Lunar items onto enemies.\nFinding a Common Printer that had its item's replaced with a Lunar item, is one of the main upsides of this item.\nEulogy Zero can make it easier to amass huge amounts of lunar items to feed into a Cleansing Pool to get many  Pearls and  Irradiant Pearls, as the holder will find lunar items in the world naturally without having to pay lunar coins (or can print non-lunar items into lunar items).\nWith high stacks of Eulogy Zero, it will take longer to Cleanse yourself, as some of the Pearls will be replaced into Lunars which will need to be cleansed again.\nIf the player is lucky enough to find an Overgrown 3D Printer afterwards, Pearls and Irradiant Pearls can then be converted into high stacks of valuable boss items.\nEulogy Zero can make it easier to find the Heresy items, as they can also replace other items.\nAlthough the chance is small, in scenarios where enemies get items, i.e.,   Void Fields, Simulacrum, Artifact of Evolution, or   Scavengers, it is possible for enemies to gain dangerous lunar items like  Shaped Glass or  Egocentrism.\nWith the Artifact of Evolution and Simulacrum, where item accruement is permanent, it is possible for monsters to gain more stacks of Eulogy Zero, which can have a snowball effect.\nSince Eulogy Zero is capable of replacing the items given to monsters from Artifact of Evolution, it is possible for monsters to eventually collect all four Heresy items and thus transform into   Heretic\n\n\n== Lore ==\nA eulogy for the victors of spiritual warfare:\n\nThis is a message from me to you.\n\nThough in life you will stumble, stammer and fall - though you will lose your loved ones and shed more tears than your eyes can muster - in time you can find peace on the planets you call home. A small creature waiting quietly for you, a smiling face from another stream, the silence as you breathe in the scent of a new season.\n\nLet your heart remind you why you are here; let it tell you something new and something old. A mind remembers, but a heart knows.\n\nI love me so that I can love you too -  I've wanted to disappear before, but I've always wanted to return to see you. The grass and the leaves, the warmth of the sun and the insects at night. \n\nI promised myself, and I promise you: \n\nA victory is the reward of cumulative loss, ever present as a light at the end of the tunnel. Even in death, there is the lingering promise of new life - forever doomed to repeat the cycle.\n\nIt's getting dark. If you get lost it's alright, for now. I hope you enjoy the shooting stars.

            "notes": "The Light Flux Pauldron is an lunar item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion. \nAfter all other cooldown reduction and attack speed modifiers are applied to the holder, this item reduces both their final attack speed and final cooldowns. Cooldowns are reduced by 50% (-50% per stack), while attack speed is multiplied by 1/(stacks + 1).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of halving attack speed per stack is incorrect. Only the first stack reduces attack speed by half; subsequent stacks have a lower penalty.\nBecause the Light Flux Pauldron's modification applies after all other changes, it makes attack speed bonuses less effective, and offers less of a cooldown reduction in the presence of other items that provide cooldown reductions.\nAfter applying the attack speed penalty, the game checks whether the value is less than 0.1 and sets it to that. Therefore, 9+ stacks will have the same effect on attack speed, assuming a starting value of 1.0.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Acrid can make good use of this item, as its utility skills (  Caustic Leap/  Frenzied Leap) and   Epidemic are not affected by attack speed. With a couple Light Flux Pauldrons, these skills can be rapidly used to great effect.\nHowever,   Vicious Wounds,   Neurotoxin, and   Ravenous Bite fire much more slowly, making them much less reliable.\n  Artificer is an excellent candidate for a Light Flux Pauldron because she is mostly cooldown-based. Her primary skills (  Flame Bolt/  Plasma Bolt) see great benefit from this item: just one stack will nearly allow for continuous firing of either primary skill. Both   Snapfreeze and   Ion Surge also benefit profoundly from cooldown reduction.\n  Flamethrower is severely weakened because attack speed determines its number of damage ticks per second, making it the lesser choice over   Ion Surge when carrying any stacks of Light Flux Pauldron.\nBoth secondary skills (  Charged Nano-Bomb/  Cast Nano-Spear) charge much more slowly. The   Charged Nano-Bomb is hurt worst, since   Cast Nano-Spear still provides the utility of freezing foes and executing low-health foes without needing to be fully charged.\nArguably, despite lowering their charge rate, a Light Flux Pauldron makes these abilities easier to use because they can be held for much longer without fully charging and automatically firing. To see any regular benefit from either secondary ability, it is recommended to take no more than one Light Flux Pauldron, as the charge rate and firing animation can become intolerably slow.\n  Bandit sees mixed results with this item. His primary skills (  Burst/  Blast) fire as quickly as the player can click, but are still negatively affected since they will take longer to reload with lower attack speed. Although   Smoke Bomb can be used to give a nearly permanent uptime of stealth with just one stack of this item, it does not deal much damage. His secondary skills  (  Serrated Dagger/  Serrated Shiv) and specials (  Lights Out/  Desperado) can be used more often, but the reduction in attack speed hampers their usefulness by making the firing animations of all of these abilities much slower.\nThe cooldown of his special skill (  Lights Out/  Desperado) is paused while he is firing it, meaning that the benefit of reducing their cooldown is offset by the drawback of delaying the start of their cooldown.(This needs testing)\n  Lights Out already fully resets itself and all of his abilities (and fully reloads his primary skill) when it executes a target, making Light Flux Pauldron especially ineffective with this skill.\nSimilarly to Bandit,   Huntress' kit changes drastically with this item. While it does hamper both   Strafe and   Flurry's rate of fire significantly and slows down   Laser Glaive's startup animation, it does allow the player to spam their secondary, utility and special (particularly   Ballista) abilities much more often. Taking this item essentially sacrifices the effectiveness of proc coefficient-dependant items and sustained damage for extra mobility and a more bursty damage output.\nThis item is excellent for   Captain's   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike, as just a single Pauldron will reduce the cooldown from 40s to 20s. The cast time of his   Orbital Supply Beacon will increase slightly, but is not that detrimental due to its limited use.\nKeep in mind that Captain's   Vulcan Shotgun will charge slower and have longer ending lag, however.\nThis item is difficult to use effectively on Survivors that scale heavily with attack speed.\nAssuming   Commando has no attack speed increases and a single Light Flux Pauldron, his   Suppressive Fire bullet count is reduced to a measly 3 bullets.\n  Engineer's   Bouncing Grenades,   Pressure Mines,   Spider Mines, and   Thermal Harpoons are all affected by attack speed.\nJust one Light Flux Pauldron allows for permanent uptime of   Bubble Shield.\nAlthough his special skills (  TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret/  TR58 Carbonizer Turret) can be placed or replaced much more frequently with the reduced cooldown, they will inherit this item and suffer from the poor attack speed. This makes them better candidates for strategies that rely on their disposability, such as using the  Fuel Array.\n  Heretic's   Hungering Gaze gets a longer cooldown and more bullets by stacking  Visions of Heresy. While it may seem useful to reduce the cooldown again using the Light Flux Pauldron, the decreased attack speed makes it more practical to just use one stack of Visions of Heresy instead.\n  Mercenary's signature {  Expose debuff leaves little use for this item, as hitting exposed enemies reduces skill cooldowns by 1 second. Even without this item, a skilled Mercenary player can constantly cycle through skills.\nUsing   Slicing Winds isn't affected by the negative attack speed, unlike   Eviscerate; making Slicing Winds more preferable if you are getting Pauldrons.\nInterestingly, by using more Light Flux Pauldrons, Mercenary will stay in his   Blinding Assault and  Focused Assault state for a much longer amount of time than normal.\n  Railgunner's   XQR Smart Round System,   M99, and   HH44 all fire much slower.   Supercharge not only takes longer to charge, but also disables her weapons for longer.\n  Active Reload scales with attack speed, changing the size of the perfect reload zone.\n  Loader isn't a bad pick with this item, as her   Grapple Fist and   Spiked Fist do not scale with attack speed, enabling incredible mobility. However, her barrier gain is significantly impacted, as   Charged Gauntlet and   Thunder Gauntlet take longer to charge and   Knuckleboom attacks slower.\n  MUL-T's   Blast Canister scales with attack speed, but can be immediately fired by sprint cancelling.   Transport Mode does not scale with attack speed, so the Light Flux Pauldron allows using both in quick succession for a very high damage rate.\n  REX with just one Light Flux Pauldron can achieve greater damage per second early on with   DIRECTIVE: Drill.   Tangling Growth can be maintained 100% of the time with ease thanks to the Pauldron's cooldown reduction, enabling excellent crowd control and healing.\nHowever, the firing speed of   DIRECTIVE: Inject is reduced, which hampers its damage and self-healing over time.\nWith enough Light Flux Pauldrons, the cast time for their utility skills (  DIRECTIVE: Disperse/  Bramble Volley) becomes high enough that REX can walk around during the delay between activating and actually firing the skill.\n  Void Fiend is terrible with the Light Flux Pauldron, as all its damaging skills are affected by lower attack speed.   Suppress and   Corrupted Suppress also take longer to cast, and have no cooldowns to begin with.\n\n\n== Math ==\nSkills' new cooldowns are determined by the formula cooldown \u22c5 0.5 ^ amount. Note that the minimum cooldown for most skills is 0.5 seconds.\nThe holder's final attack speed, however, is determined differently, with the formula attackSpeed \u22c5 1/(amount + 1).\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"The wind guides us all. Listen to the song of the wind, and dance according to its instruction. You will find yourself dodging every blow, countering every strike. You will find that the wind will lift you up, making you as free as a fallen autumn leaf. But heed, and do not lose yourself to the wind. Running is a viable option, though eventually you will find yourself with nowhere left to run to.\"\n\n-Will of Combat, Second Excerpt\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe item's lore entry seems to refer to its function. Its reduction of firing rate will make fights generally take longer, but since the majority of survivors have at least one movement-related skill with a cooldown, the cooldown reduction will often make it easier to dodge attacks, and perhaps more notably, flee from unfavorable fights that may result from the player's reduced offensive capabilities. The last line of the lore seems to caution against relying on this hit-and-run style too much, as the limited size of each stage naturally means that the whole map could eventually fill up with all the enemies a player keeps running from.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Light Flux Pauldron",

However, any gold obtained while holding this item is converted into experience, and gold costs are increased by 50% (+50% per stack).\n\n\n== Math ==\nEvery 25 (Scaled With Time) gold that would be gained is instead converted into 12% (+1.25% per stack, up to 20.75% at 8 stacks) of the experience required to reach the next level.\nThe cost per level up is decided by this formula and calculated on entering a stage:\n\nFor more information check The Math of Scaling Difficulty\n\nThe cost of a level increases over time, at the same rate as other gold costing interactable.\nThe cost is unaffected by Longstanding Solitudes downside.\nLarge amounts of Gold are often cut off and will not necessarily always equate to a level up, but gradual gold gains can use this table as a general reference.\n\nGaining $209, 3 times, results in 3 Levels.\nGaining $627 all at once, results in ~~2.2 levels\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The increased XP gain per stack is not mentioned in-game.\nThe cost per XP gain does not increase by 50% like the cost of interactables.\nThis makes stacking not have a downside in Single-Player\nThis is one of the few items that has arbitrary stack limitations.\nStacking past 3 does not increase the amount of   Free Unlock per level.\nStacking past 8 does not increase the amount of XP per 25$.\nGaining multiple leves at once through too much gold, will not result in multiple   Free Unlock.\nThis is very unlikely to happen in regular gameplay.\nThe holder gains the experience from converted gold in addition to the experience they would normally get with killing an enemy\nThis item prevents the player from charging Halcyon Shrine's, as they are unable to hold gold.\nThis item prevents getting more missiles with  War Bonds.\nUpon reaching the level cap of 94, the player will be unable to get more free purchases.\nIf they run out of their   Free Unlocks, they will be unable to purchase anything until they get rid of the item.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nEconomy items like the  Brittle Crown,  Defiant Gouge, the  Roll of Pennies, or the  Ghor's Tome greatly amplify the upside of this item.\n Brittle Crown can be especially strong since the player will always be at 0 gold and therefore be unable to lose any when getting hit.\n Defiant Gouge is especially strong when you find a Shrine of Chance, since it may take several of your   Free Unlocks to get both items.\nIt's best to avoid   Gilded Coast while holding Longstanding Solitude in single-player, as it will take 7   Free Unlock stacks to activate the beacons and kill   Aurelionite.\nIf you dont kill the boss fast enough, you would need to repeat this.\nIf the player is already at the level cap, you are locked in the area without escape.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nDay 1\nThe chilly coin in my pocket hums softly, drawing me off path. A pulsing blue pod is lodged in the earth here, covered in morning frost. Even through gloves, the coin burns colder than ever. I\u2019m terrified and compelled to place the coin on the pod, it snaps open.\nA dark gel oozes out, carrying a round device and tablet to my feet. The device activates and pulls the tablet with it into a hover. A construct? I know I should have shot it down, but I\u2026 feel it wants to help me get stronger.\nI touch the construct. Thousands of years push their way into my skull, the mounting pressure makes me howl in a voice I don\u2019t recognize, then nothing.\n---\nA pounding migraine wakes me. Midday. I feel moss under me and shield my eyes against the canopy light. I am closer to RallyPoint, but how? Disfigured beetles lay dead in a radius around me, faces distorted, limbs bent. I vomit. The construct hovers protectively nearby. How did it do this?\nDay 2\nStudying the tablet brings no comfort. I worry about Huang. The isolation grates on me, I\u2019m exhausted, hungry, angry. I finally found a supply chest but the construct absorbed my coin before I could use it. This lowly thing thinks it knows best. I don\u2019t know what came over me but I attacked the construct. It didn\u2019t seem to mind but that only made me feel worse. I am not myself.\nDay 3\nThe full moon\u2019s light makes me itch. It pursues me from it\u2019s dark sea, sluggish and unnerving. I stare into it, nearly falling into it\u2019s gaze. For hours I run terrified in the wrong direction. I cannot face it, not how I am. Under a deep canopy I draw familiar power from the construct. Inky feathers break through the skin of my arms and hands. I black out.\nDay 4\nThat blasted thing isn\u2019t cheap, the construct is obsessed with coin, but I can\u2019t argue with the results. The Lemurians barely put up a fight, obliterated, distracted by their song.\nThe last one drops from my talons.\nThey never should have been here in the first place.

Strong-hitting enemies like the   Stone Golem become more threatening when holding this item.\nBarrier items like the  Topaz Brooch pair well with Shaped Glass, as barrier decays slower with lower maximum health and provides much-needed survivability.\n Tougher Times and  Repulsion Armor Plate are invaluable items to use with Shaped Glass. The Armor Plate mitigates damage-over-time effects such as{  Burn, and attacks from light-hitting enemies like the  Lesser Wisp.\nTougher Times's void counterpart,  Safer Spaces, may prove more reliable than its uncorrupted version, as it is guaranteed to block a hit.

However, it also decreases the holder's movement speed by 50% (+50% per stack).\n\nBug: The speed reduction is applied twice, reducing speed by 33% on first stack as a result.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The description that it halves movement speed is inaccurate. The effect is reciprocal as it multiplies the movement speed by 1/(1+stacks). One stack will indeed halve movement speed, but additional stacks will have a diminishing effect. However, even this is not the complete picture, as movement speed is actually calculated as baseValue\u00d7sumOfIncreases/sumOfDecreases. As such, if the player has already accrued a lot of other sources of negative contributions, one stack of this item will not halve the overall stat value but have a diminishing effect.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nFor most characters and builds, keep in mind that the movement speed penalty of Stone Flux Pauldron will generally be far more troublesome than the accompanying health bonus is worth. The vast majority of enemy attacks come in the form of close-range melee, projectiles with a travel time, and telegraphed area-of-effect attacks. All these attacks also generally will not track a moving player and instead lag behind. As such, the loss of one's ability to effectively dodge these attacks and/or flee from unfavorable fights will more than likely end up meaning they'll take a lot of damage that they could have otherwise avoided. Often, the player may end up taking far more damage than the extra health of the Pauldron can defend them from.\nThis speed penalty also complicates one's ability to get around each stage in order to search for interactables, and as such, might make it difficult to keep up with the time-based scaling of the game's difficulty. This may be exacerbated in multiplayer games, where a player with one or more Stone Flux Pauldron(s) could have trouble getting to chests and other sources of items before the faster player(s) can pick the stage clean.\nThe \"suffocation\" effects presented by the   Void Fields,   Void Locus,   The Planetarium, and Void Seeds are also made far more dangerous, as their damage scales with the player's maximum health anyways. The Pauldron will not make the player survive any longer inside the void, and the movement penalty will leave them slowly trudging through ever-damaging fog.\nSimilarly, the implosion attacks of dying   Void Reavers,   Void Jailers, and other such Void enemies will kill in one hit regardless of health, making a swift escape more or less the only option to survive them.\nDue to the mathematics of how a player's movement speed is calculated, it is generally a losing battle to try to overcome the Pauldron's speed penalty by taking items which give movement speed bonuses, especially when taking more than one Pauldron. Each one taken will more than double the number of  Mocha,  Paul's Goat Hooves, and  Energy Drinks necessary to break even and return to normal movement speed.\nA notable quirk revealed by the exceptionally low movement speeds possible by stacking Stone Flux Pauldrons is the fact that a player's friction with the ground is directly tied to their movement speed. As such, stacking many Pauldrons will make the player incredibly slippery, making it rather difficult to manage the knockback caused by enemy attacks (especially explosions like the   Jellyfish's self-detonation) or the recoil from their own skills (such as   Railgunner's   XQR Smart Round System).\nWith all these factors in mind, it may be better to cut losses with respect to movement speed and instead focus on alternative means of movement that are unaffected by the movement speed stat.\nA skilled   Loader can make great use of this item, as she can rely on the momentum from her   Charged Gauntlet or   Thunder Gauntlet to get moving, and use her   Grapple Fist or   Spiked Fist to redirect her momentum and close gaps between herself and nearby enemies.\n  MUL-T's high base health and innate ability to grant itself considerable amounts of armor with its assorted skills makes it an excellent candidate for leveraging the benefits of the Stone Flux Pauldron. The push it receives from the ending burst of   Auto-Nailgun also offers a means to compensate for the loss in movement speed, especially when used in conjunction with   Power Mode. Timing the release of two Auto-Nailgun bursts along with a simultaneous jump allows for a directed leap that can carry the player a considerable distance, and the nailguns will usually be ready to fire again just a moment or two after hitting the ground, even without any boosts to firing speed.\n  False Son makes great use of Stone Flux Pauldron's health benefit courtesy of his Growth, as it is a very easy method of obtaining more health at a negligible speed deficit, given his already slow movement speed.\nPicking up a  Wax Quail or two will grant the player an alternate means of movement regardless of their chosen Survivor, as the boost it gives when a sprinting player jumps is calculated to send them a certain distance forwards, regardless of the player's movement speed. Do keep in mind that having too many Quails may make it difficult to make precise movements, especially with the implicit reduction in friction.\nWith the  H3AD-5T v2, the item's ability to crash down to the ground after holding the interact key will allow for the player to halt their momentum in mid-air, should they need to. The item's extra effect of negating all fall damage is also especially helpful in this scenario: The player's low traction and reliance on less-controllable means of movement will make falling off of ledges much more common, and fall damage is calculated as a percentage of the player's health, making it hit harder for high-health players.\nOn all survivors, jumping without providing any directional input (WASD/movement stick) will completely halt any non-vertical momentum. This gives a player with several Stone Flux Pauldrons a consistent means to slow down without having to rely on their immensely reduced friction, so long as they are on the ground to start with.\nThe Stone Flux Pauldron's health boost synergizes best with items and abilities that benefit from the player taking damage, help the extra health last longer, aid with healing, and/or scale positively with the player's maximum health.\nThe  Roll of Pennies and especially  Razorwire are quintessential for their ability to benefit from the player being damaged, supplying a tanky player with exceptional sources of gold and damage output, respectively.\nAlthough helpful at first, items that grant flat healing, such as  Harvester's Scythe and  Leeching Seed, will quickly be outstripped by the comparatively massive pool of maximum health that stacking several Stone Flux Pauldrons can offer. Instead, it's generally better to focus on items and equipment that heal for a percentage of maximum health, such as  Medkit,  Interstellar Desk Plant,  Strides of Heresy, and  Foreign Fruit.\nSimilarly, the flat damage reduction of  Repulsion Armor Plate and  Planula will be dwarfed by the damage of heftier blows that are normally much easier to dodge; for this, consider pursuing items that instead boost armor, such as the  Jade Elephant.\n Helfire Tincture and  N'kuhana's Opinion are uniquely powerful in combination with Stone Flux Pauldron, as they are the only means of offense with a damage output that scales with the user's maximum health instead of their base damage stat. A massive health pool from the Pauldron will give a correspondingly massive damage boost for both of these items.\nSince this is the only item that reduces movement speed (excluding  Tonic Affliction), the Stone Flux Pauldron can be used in long runs where a player is overwhelmed by extreme levels of speed, making movement much easier to manage.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Much like the earth, you must be sturdy and inflexible. Completely and utterly immovable, in both body and mind. Fear not the sword of your enemy, visualize it shattering against your skin. Focus, and make it true. Fear not the tumbling avalanche, visualize it yielding to your will. But heed, and do not fight without reason.

High stacks can result in more time out of reality than in, which can be excessive without something like  N'kuhana's Opinion.\nShadowfade will not prevent damage from Shrines of Blood, nor environmental damage such as fall damage or suffocation damage in the   Void Fields.\nShadowfade does not remove damage over time effects when activated.\nEntering a wormhole from the  Eccentric Vase immediately ends the duration of Shadowfade.\nObtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the   Heretic.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item is especially useful for   Commando and   REX (without their alternate utility skill unlocked), since Shadowfade is debatably an upgrade over their default utility skills.\n  Mercenary,   Loader,   Captain, and   Seeker have their damage outputs substantially lowered with their utility skills replaced.\nLoader in particular relies on her utility for the majority of her damage output, and as such Strides of Heresy should NEVER be taken on her unless the player is aiming to become the   Heretic.\nSeeker's utility skill   Sojourn does much of the same as Shadowfade, though you lose invincibility from Shrines of Blood and fall damage, as well as the explosion from exiting Sojourn.\n  Artificer gives up   Snapfreeze for Shadowfade, but can take unique advantage of the flight effect with her   ENV Suit. Hovering throughout the cooldown effectively grants her slow but unlimited flight, even without   Ion Surge.\nIt also gives Artificer a powerful defensive option for quickly falling back from danger. While Ion Surge is definitely a strong option for retreating, it still pales in comparison to complete invulnerability. Extra healing also ensures she can get back into the fight faster after sustaining damage.\nFor all other characters, such as   Huntress,   Bandit,   Railgunner,   False Son,   Chef and   MUL-T, this item is more of a toss-up, and up to user preference.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cHer legs were scattered to the two poles of the moon, twisted in a wicked position, in a field of obsidian thorns\u2026\"\n\n-The Evisceration of Kur-skan the Heretic, V\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix   Shadowfade not being usable by   Captain in hidden realms\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nGameplay Changes\nNo longer puts you in combat\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nBug Fixes\n\ud83c\udf27 Fix a variety of effects still showing when using Strides of Heresy\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Strides of Heresy\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Lunar Item: Strides of Heresy\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe foreign leg resembles that of the   Alloy Vultures.\nSpecifically, it is one of the legs of   Kur-skan the Heretic.",

            "notes": "The Transcendence is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2.\nIt increases the holder's maximum health by 50% (+25% per stack), but replaces all but 1 of their health with shields, which regenerate over a period of 2 seconds after avoiding damage for 7 seconds. Any health gained afterwards, such as by leveling up or picking up health-increasing items, will also be increased and converted into shields.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe holder needs to avoid damage for 7 seconds before they can begin regaining shields. Mobility and dodging are crucial to using this item.\nBecause shields cannot be healed outside of recharging naturally, healing items become redundant.\n N'kuhana's Opinion continues to store healing by using the new shield-based maximum health for all calculations.\nObtaining an  Aegis transforms all excess healing into barriers.\nPercentage-based healing, such as  Bustling Fungus and  Foreign Fruit, will calculate their healing based on the holder's new maximum health of 1, making them effectively useless even with an Aegis.\nConversely, in the event that the player has little to no healing, the Transcendence can be a great help, providing a way to regain health more quickly.\nTaking damage over time can delay the timer for the health regeneration until the effect wears off. Be especially sure to avoid damage from these sources.\n Infusion and  Bison Steak benefit from the Transcendence's health increase, but the  Personal Shield Generator does not. Keep this in mind when choosing how to further augment health.\n Tougher Times will allow the player to have a chance to recharge shields in combat, and  Old War Stealthkits can help the user regain their shields out of danger by temporarily cloaking them.\nObtaining 3 or more stacks of  Strides of Heresy, or a single stack of Strides of Heresy and a  Hardlight Afterburner, makes   Shadowfade last long enough for the player to fully recharge their shields while invulnerable.\nSince fall damage calculation uses the player's health without accounting for shields or barriers, the Transcendence effectively reduces all fall damage to 1 point.\nThis makes the Transcendence useful for Survivors who lack skills to avoid fall damage, namely   Engineer,   Captain, and   MUL-T.\nThis item should be avoided at all costs when using   REX's \"plant\" skills that cost health (  Seed Barrage,   Bramble Volley, and   Tangling Growth). The Transcendence completely dismantles these skills' internal synergy of damaging REX to attack and healing to recoup the costs, and as a result it is colloquially known as a run-killer for this Survivor.\nThe  Silence Between Two Strikes equipment does not apply the 50% shield effect if the survivor has Transcendence, since all of the survivor's health is already converted into shield.\nA player holding Transcendence becomes functionally immune to the   healing disabled debuff of   Malachite Elites, as shield regeneration is not considered healing.\nHowever, they must still contend with Malachite monsters' greatly increased attack strength.\nSince the Transcendence sets the holder's health regeneration to 0, the negative health regeneration on the   Heretic is removed, preventing her from inevitably dying over time.\nHolding Transcendence and  Kinetic Dampener essentailly grants permanent armor, although you won't be able to activate the stunning pulse unless you survive a hit with 1 health.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nYou are trying your best to survive.

They are unlocked and start appearing in runs after completing the Blockade Breaker Challenge.\nObtaining the Visions of Heresy will replace the Survivor's primary attack (M1 by default) with the Hungering Gaze skill.\n\n\n== Synergies ==\nOn very long runs, this item can be useful for   Acrid,   Loader, and   Mercenary, since enemies will be so powerful that being in melee range is dangerous. However, on a normal-length run, the Visions of Heresy are a downgrade for these Survivors.\nHungering Gaze also removes Loader's main way to activate her   Scrap Barrier passive. Gather other items to make up for the lost survivability.\nOn Survivors with primary attacks that have high fire rates and/or many projectiles, such as   Commando,   Captain and   MUL-T, Hungering Gaze is a direct downgrade due to its recharge cooldown.\nOn   Artificer, replacing her primary with Hungering Gaze is generally better when holding a lot of on-hit items, such as AtG Missile Mk. 1, and more of a toss-up when holding none.\nThe only case when replacing Artificer's primary could be detrimental is when the {  Burn from   Flame Bolt is contributing to a  Death Mark, or is being boosted by  Ignition Tank.\nAs with most items, Visions of Heresy will affect   Engineer's turrets as well as himself. This means that Engineer can use Hungering Gaze instead of the clunky   Bouncing Grenades, and his turrets will also gain Hungering Gaze. This increases Engineer's damage output as well as his turrets', making it an all-around excellent choice.\nBecause Hungering Gaze has a cooldown, attack speed items are reduced in effectiveness. Bonus attack speed does increase the rate at which the 12 bullets are fired, but will not modify the cooldown at all, resulting in a lower expected increase in damage output.\nCooldown reduction items such as the  Bandolier and  Brainstalks can help mitigate this downside.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe delayed explosions can trigger on-hit items independently of the initial hits.\nThis item has a special interaction with the   final boss.\nObtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the   Heretic.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"\u2026and for her betrayal, and her lies, and her scheming ways, the Heretic was violently separated into four distinctive pieces, each to be scattered across the farthest depths of the Moon. \n\nFirst, her many eyes were plucked from her skull and sealed in boiling glass, forced to gaze upon her failure...\u201d\n\n-The Evisceration of Kur-skan the Heretic, III\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix Visions of Heresy interacting with   Captain\u2019s orbital drop\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nBug Fixes\nFixed Visions of Heresy allowing   Huntress\u2019   Ballista to exceed three shots\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4892828)\nBug Fixes\nFix the   Hungering Gaze being reset by   Thermal Harpoons\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lunar Item: Visions of Heresy\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Visions of Heresy",

            "notes": "The Benthic Bloom is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and corrupts all  57 Leaf Clover's . \nAt the start of each stage, the item selects 3 (+3 per stack) random Common or Uncommon items in the holder's inventory. Each stack of a selected item randomly transforms into an equal-sized stack of a random item of the next higher rarity (for example, a stack of 4  Mocha would transform into 4 of a random green item). \n\n\n== Notes ==\nLegendary, boss, Meal, void, lunar, and untiered items (such as  Tonic Affliction,  Empty Bottle, etc) cannot be transformed.\nThe items are chosen at random regardless of rarity, stacks, or pick-up history. The items in the transformation rarity are shuffled and if the selected item belongs in any of the Damage, Healing, or Utility categories, the items in the transformation rarity are ordered to include those first. For example,  Mocha will prioritise any Uncommon Damage/Utility items to transform into.\nThis means if the selected item is either White Scrap or Green Scrap, no items will be prioritised for the transformation.\n 57 Leaf Clover is not excluded from being upgraded into, meaning the Benthic Bloom will inevitably start to duplicate itself at an exponential rate.\nIf a player has less items than the total that Benthic Bloom would upgrade at once, it's possible for it to select the same item twice. This means that an item can go straight from Common to Legendary in a single stage.\nAdditionally, identical items are consolidated into a single stack even in the middle of the Bloom's transformation sequence. This means a stack of a Common item can be upgraded twice if it combines with a stack of an Uncommon item the player already has. For example, if the player has 1  Mocha, 1  Soldier's Syringe, and 1  Shuriken, it is possible for the Benthic Bloom to first upgrade the Mocha and Soldier's Syringe into 2 Shurikens (for a total stack of 3 Shurikens). After this, it is possible that the third and final upgrade will be to upgrade the Shurikens into 3  Brilliant Behemoth. While this is an improbable scenario, it is not impossible.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nObtaining a Benthic Bloom in the first few stages of a run can lead to a massive boost in power by giving the player more Uncommon and Legendary items than normal by the end of the first loop, with the tradeoff of not having as many stacks of Common items.\nOn the other hand, since the Benthic Bloom transforms full stacks of the chosen items, obtaining it very late in a looping run may cause more trouble than it is worth. Suddenly losing all stacks of offensive items such as  Lens-Maker's Glasses or  AtG Missile Mk. 1 can drastically reduce damage output, losing healing & utility items such as  Leeching Seed or  Tougher Times can make it much harder to survive, and because very few legendary items grant movement speed or mobility, this can be a big issue if  Paul's Goat Hoof,  Energy Drink, or  Wax Quail are lost.\nOne of the largest downsides of this item is that it will eventually consolidate the players items into stacks of Legendary items, most of which have very weak benefits when being stacked.\n Growth Nectar is one of the only reliable sources of speed and other stats as well as stacking very well, however the lack of lower tier items can make it harder to retain buffs for its effects\n Wake of Vultures is the most reliable method to retain multiple buffs especially when gaining multiple stacks. Getting stacks of both of these items can highly offset the downsides of Benthic Bloom.\nMaking good use of the items that cannot be converted is the most reliable way to keep on top of Benthic Bloom's random variance.\nBecause Void items cannot be transformed, corrupting items can keep them \"safe\" from being lost, albeit with a different effect.\nMeal items are also unable to be transformed, allowing the player to always be able to rely on their powerful effects.\nLunar items can also help cover for any weaknesses the player may suffer from. A full uptime  Spinel Tonic can help with speed,  Shaped Glass can help with damage and  Corpsebloom is extremely powerful healing due to the very high chance of gaining multiple stacks of  Rejuvenation Rack.\nPicking up this item will entirely prevent the player from obtaining  Ultimate Meal for the run since it specifically requires using clovers to be crafted.\nHowever if the player were to craft Ultimate Meal first they can make use of Benthic Bloom's effects while still retaining a large luck increase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Luck? Who needs luck, in a place like this.\n\nTo survive here, you'd need more than just luck. You need intuition. Instinct. The right tools. Power.\n\nI know you're scared. And I am too.

The effective chance is (42.37%/50.84%/6.79%).\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of (60%/30%/10%) is incorrect.\nAs void items do not have a discernible rarity and all fall under the same umbrella of void, their \"rarity\" as considered for the cache's drop chances is the rarity of the uncorrupted counterparts (e.g. the  Needletick is the corruption of the  Tri-Tip Dagger, a white item, and so the Needletick is considered a \"white\" void item).\nVoid caches will spawn even if the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled.\nIf the Artifact of Command is active, the void cache rarity will always be common.\nThe Encrusted Key will only corrupt other Rusted Keys while at least 1 Encrusted Key is in the player's inventory.

            "notes": "The Lost Seer's Lenses are a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of the  Lens-Maker's Glasses.\nUpon hitting a non-boss enemy, there is a 0.5% (+0.5% per stack) chance to instantly kill it, multiplied by the attack's proc coefficient. This chance is affected by luck.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nObtaining 200 Lost Seer's Lenses causes every hit to a non-boss to result in an instant kill.\nA non-boss enemy counts as anything without a red health bar. A \"boss\" should not be confused with Boss Monsters or monsters holding  Infusion, which has the same red health bar, but are not designated as bosses.\nRed health bars can appear for Teleporter Event bosses and Simulacrum boss waves; Lost Seer's Lenses will be ineffective against these enemies.\nSince the Lost Seer's Lenses are ineffective against boss enemies and the  Armor-Piercing Rounds only work on boss enemies, Armor-Piercing Rounds can help make up the lost damage against bosses.\nWhen the player hits an enemy and the instant-kill roll succeeds, it adds a Void Death damage type to the attack, similar to the   Void Reaver's implosion, which causes instant death with a unique visual of inflicting massive damage. Because the  Brilliant Behemoth inherits the damage type of the triggering hit, if the attack that activates the Behemoth succeeds the instant-kill roll, then the Behemoth's explosion will also instantly kill anything it hits.\nThis also allows the player to instantly kill bosses because they are also vulnerable to the instant-kill damage type. For example, by instantly killing an enemy that is sufficiently close to a boss, the Behemoth's explosion can transfer this instant-kill roll. However,   Mithrix and   Voidling are immune to Void Death effects, so this scenario does not work on them.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nHaving  57 Leaf Clovers can greatly improve the rate of instant killing.\nInstantly killing a   Gup will prevent it from splitting into   Geep. Other enemy on-death effects are unaffected however.\nWhen carrying a large quantity of Lens-Maker's Glasses alongside critical-related items (e.g.  Harvester's Scythe), picking up the Lost Seer's Lenses may end up being detrimental.\nThe player can make up for lost critical chance by using the  Ocular HUD, though only while the buff is active.\n  Bandit's   Backstab and   Railgunner's   Magnetic Accelerator can still consistently allow for the effects of critical-related items without needing  Lens-Maker's Glasses, making this item more viable for them.\nFor Bandit, instant kills triggered by   Desperado will grant a   Desperado Stack and instant kills triggered by   Lights Out will reset cooldowns\nWith the exception of Railgunner, having more than 10 Lens-Maker's Glasses (100% crit chance) is often pointless, so corrupting them can be useful if the player has passed that threshold, allowing the player to get the most out of 11+ Lens-Maker's Glasses.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"What does it mean to see?\n\nTo a beast, it means to identify potential food and mates. To propagate, to survive. Sight is nothing more than a means to an end, is it not?\n\nTo someone like me... To those who know true purpose... To see is to LIVE.

            "notes": "The Needletick is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corrupted version of the  Tri-Tip Dagger. \nOn hit, it gives a 10% (+10% per stack) chance to inflict   Collapse on the target (which is multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient). 3 seconds after Collapse is first applied to a target, the effect will trigger, removing all stacks of Collapse on the target and dealing 400% damage per stack removed.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n  Bleed effects from  Noxious Thorn and  Shatterspleen will not be replaced by Collapse.\nEnemies inflicted with Collapse have a pulsing red circle displayed on top of them, which grows in size and flashes more vigorously when Collapse is about to deal damage.\nIf an enemy dies before Collapse deals damage, the circle will remain at the position where it died.\nBecause Collapse is of type Damage over Time, the damage dealt has a proc coefficient of 0.0.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nNoxious Thorn and Shatterspleen can still be used to apply bleed if Tri-Tip Daggers are corrupted, effectively allowing for both debuffs from Tri-Tip Daggers and Needleticks to apply simultaneously.\nTri-Tip and Shatterspleen do not apply two separate stacks of bleed making Tri-Tip daggers obsolete if players have enough crit chance for Shatterspleen. If players have Shatterspleen, it would be prudent to get Needleticks to get both Collapse and Bleed on hit.\nOne stack of Bleed deals a total of 240% base damage over 3 seconds, while one stack of Collapse deals 400% base damage after 3 seconds. All stacks of Bleed have their durations refreshed when an additional new stack is inflicted, while all Collapse stacks expire at once after the 3-second countdown begins.\nAs a result, if the player has enough Tri-Tip Daggers and hit rate to repeatedly reset Bleed stacks, Bleed will outperform Collapse, especially in long fights. However, the Needletick is still useful at low stacks when resetting Bleed would be unlikely, or for Survivors with very low hit rate.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nWelcome to DataScraper (v3.1.53 \u2013 beta branch)\n$ Scraping memory... done.\n$ Resolving... done.\n$ Combing for relevant data... done.\nComplete\n\nThe following has been flagged as evidence for use in the trial of Titan v.

            "notes": "The Newly Hatched Zoea is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void update. It is the corruption of all boss items (excluding  Artifact Keys,  Encrypted Cerebellums,  Exposed Cerebellums,  Prison Matrices, and  Sentry Keys) and is dropped by the   Void Devastator.\nEvery 60 seconds (-50% per stack), the holder gets a friendly void ally, which is either a   Void Reaver,   Void Jailer, or (rarely)   Void Devastator. The holder may only have up to 1 (+1 per stack) void ally summoned this way at a time.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The rate of cooldown is not -50% exponentially per stack, as the actual formula is 60/stacks. So while going from 1 to 2 stacks the cooldown increases by 50%, this does not follow the same pattern for any other stack number.\nSince the   Void Devastator cannot normally spawn as a teleporter boss, the only way to obtain this item from the teleporter event is during a void Family Event, which makes it possible for it to spawn as a teleporter boss.\nAlternatively, one may acquire this item from a resurrection via  Pluripotent Larva, as long as a boss item was taken beforehand.\nObtaining this item by corrupting a boss item with the  Pluripotent Larva will not unlock the Newly Hatched Zoea's logbook entry. To unlock its logbook entry, it has to be picked up as an item dropped by a   Void Devastator.\nAnother option is using a  Trophy Hunter's Tricorn on a Void Devastator that can spawn within a Void Seed. However, this will probably not happen in the first few stages as the difficulty coefficient will not be high enough to afford the spawn (see Camp Director for more information).\nThis item will also corrupt the  Pearl and  Irradiant Pearl, since they have the Boss rarity.\nThis item also corrupts  Halcyon Seeds due to its Boss rarity.\nUmbrae from the Artifact of Vengeance will inherit the item and spawn Void allies, but will never drop the Newly Hatched Zoea, even if it was the Umbra's only item.\nThe void ally types to spawn are added to a pool, with 15 copies of   Void Reaver, 15 copies of   Void Jailer, and 1 copy of   Void Devastator. This gives probabilities of roughly 3.2% for a Devastator, and 48.3% for either a Reaver or Jailer.\nIf the Artifact of Chaos is enabled, any   Void Reaver spawned from the item cannot target allies, even when aggravated. However, allies can still be damaged by their basic attack if it hits them when it's hitting an enemy.\nThe void implosion created by allied void enemies can kill the player and their allies.\nThe   Void Devastator is the only enemy that can drop Newly Hatched Zoea, even with Artifact of Command.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Engineer's turrets do inherit the Newly Hatched Zoea, allowing for 2 additional void allies per item stack.\nOn top of that, respawning the turrets will allow for even more void allies. This is because the reference to the deployable count of the replaced turret disappears, even though the void allies it spawned are not affected.\nIf   Engineer has  Pluripotent Larva and any boss item, turrets will gain Newly Hatched Zoea upon dying and being resurrected even though the Engineer will not. This is the only indirect way of spawning void allies without the player holding the item.\nVoid implosions from void allies are still lethal to the player and their other void allies. Be mindful that one ally's death may lead to avalanching instant-kill explosions.\nNotably, these void implosions cannot kill any of the final bosses;   Mithrix,   Voidling,   Solus Wing   False Son, and   Solus Heart.\nThere is a global ally limit of 20 at a time. This includes void allies, drones,   Squid Turrets, or any other ally that appears on the left side of the screen. This means the ally spawn scaling of Newly Hatched Zoea hard caps at 20 stacks without any other allies. The cooldown however will be 3s, and will continue to decrease with further stacks.\nUnlike the normal void enemies, the allied void monsters spawned by this item take damage from   Void Fog/  Void Fog Strong, making them less effective in places like the   Void Fields and   Void Locus. Several stacks of Zoea can be increasingly dangerous in these areas since it increases the number of void allies and the rate they spawn, coupled with the generally slow movement speed of these allies means that when they die from Void Fog damage they'll cause void implosions nearby the small radius of 'safe' zones that players will be within to charge objectives.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn biology, the term \"zoea\" refers to a larval stage in development experienced by many ten-legged crustaceans, especially crabs.\nThis is in keeping with the crab-like appearance of the boss tied to the item, the   Void Devastator, which seems to imply that the item itself is some form of the boss's offspring.\nFurthermore, the item's ability to summon a   Void Reaver or   Void Jailer, as opposed to just the   Void Devastator which dropped it in the first place, might suggest that all three monsters are directly related to one another in some way.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nLab Dissection Analysis File\n\nSubject: Newly Hatched Zoea\n\nTechnician: X.

            "notes": "The Plasma Shrimp is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of the  AtG Missile Mk. 1. \nOn hitting an enemy, if the player has any shield, they will launch a homing missile that deals 40% (+40% per stack) total damage with a proc coefficient of 0.2. In addition, the first Plasma Shrimp the player acquires gives shield equal to 10% of their maximum health.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of +50% total damage per stack is incorrect.\nHaving any number of Plasma Shrimps will make the shield bar pink, instead of the normal blue color. This includes other shield sources such as  Personal Shield Generator and  Transcendence.\nShields cannot be healed by conventional means, and will only replenish after avoiding damage for 7 seconds.\nThe shield gained from the Plasma Shrimp is affected by anything that modifies the holder's maximum health, such as the  Shaped Glass and  Stone Flux Pauldron: when the player's maximum health is modified, the amount of shields they gain is increased or reduced by the same amount.\nThe missiles fired by Plasma Shrimp act differently than every other missile in the game, rapidly homing on the target while ignoring other enemies and terrain. If the original target dies, missiles will not search for a new target.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAny damage with a proc coefficient greater than 0.0 triggers the Plasma Shrimp. This makes attacks with lower coefficients very effective, since it effectively increases the proc coefficient of them by 0.2.\nThe Plasma Shrimp can be especially useful on skills that can quickly fire multiple projectiles, such as   Bandit's   Burst, as well as skills with relatively high attack speed, such as   MUL-T's   Auto-Nailgun.\nThis is notably effective with many items that have low proc coefficients.  Visions of Heresy always triggers Plasma Shrimp twice per shot- once for the initial 0.1 hit, and once for the delayed 1.0 hit,  Ukulele & it's void counterpart  Polylute are both notable because they hit multiple times and each individual hit always procs a Plasma Shrimp with their 0.2 proc coefficient.\nIt's worth noting that Plasma Shrimp activates on-hit items more frequently and quickly than  AtG Missile Mk. 1, but comes at the cost of dealing less damage from TOTAL damage items such as  Ukulele.\nHaving the  Transcendence (or, more rarely, the  Shared Design) will turn the player's entire health bar into shields. This makes the Plasma Shrimp always active, granting a consistent increase in damage output.\nThe  Pocket I.C.B.M. triples the projectiles fired by the Plasma Shrimp, drastically increasing its damage and number of on-hit procs.\nRemoving the luck-based element of the  AtG Missile Mk. 1 allows a player to use the Plasma Shrimp without being affected by the downside of  Purity. However, if they have increased luck, the Plasma Shrimp can potentially become a damage loss.\nAt one  57 Leaf Clover,  AtG Missile Mk. 1 deals more damage on average if the triggering Proc Coefficient is 0.7 or better. With two stacks of  57 Leaf Clover, AtG Missile wins out if triggering Proc Coefficient is as low as 0.5; any lower than this, and Shrimp Missile is still productive. These numbers don't necessarily apply to activating on-hit effects. This theory does not account for increased stacks of AtG Missile Mk. 1s which has more single damage potential than Plasma Shrimp.\nIt's important to note that should you have a  Polylute, Plasma Shrimp is going to be resulting in more damage in nearly every scenario, regardless of how many  57 Leaf Clover you have. Polylute hitting an enemy multiple times pairs extremely well with Plasma Shrimp as mentioned before, and with more clovers, Polylute will trigger more often, resulting in more extra damage from Plasma Shrimp.\nAlthough the Plasma Shrimp is more effective at stacking status effects on enemies than the AtG Missile Mk. 1 in nearly all cases (since it adds +0.2 proc coefficient while the AtG adds 10% of the original), its low proc coefficient means that the extra stacks inflicted will have extremely low duration. However, this is still useful for attacks that have a low proc coefficient themselves.\nNotably, because stacks of   Bleed from the  Tri-Tip Dagger and  Shatterspleen are refreshed when a higher-duration stack is inflicted, the extra stacks of Bleed from the Plasma Shrimp can be reset repeatedly.\nIt is worth noting that unlike the  AtG Missile Mk. 1, Plasma Shrimp cannot be used at the Wandering CHEF, potentially locking the user out of the recipes for  Runic Lens,  Pocket I.C.B.M.,  Disposable Missile Launcher,  Molten Perforator and  Charged Perforator. This has the added effect of making  Saut\u00e9ed Worms significantly harder to obtain.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"I believe there is a benefit to attacking from behind an impenetrable defense.

As a result, the Pluripotent Larva is an excellent alternative to extra lives and can be found much easier with the use of  Encrusted Keys.\nDepending on how many items can be corrupted at the time of revival, this item could be detrimental depending on the corruptible items in question.\n Lysate Cell may be useless with certain abilities such as   MUL-T's   Retool, where its uncorrupted variant could be far more useful.\nConverting 57 Leaf Clovers into  Benthic Blooms removes the player's luck and also begins randomly upgrading their items to higher tiers, which could remove valuable common/uncommon items.\n Newly Hatched Zoea will convert all boss items, which can take away very powerful sources of damage.\nConverting  Lens-Maker's Glasses  into  Lost Seer's Lenses can be very detrimental if the player has several skills or items involved with crit, or is planning to fight one of the final bosses.\n Runald's and  Kjaro's Bands will be converted to  Singularity Bands, which can be devastating to high burst damage survivors like   Loader,   Artificer, and   Railgunner, as the Singularity Band deals much less damage than the other bands, and has double the cooldown.\nIf the player encounters a  Benthic Bloom and has access to a  Recycler, they can convert the item into a Pluripotent Larva 100% of the time. This is because these are the only two Void Legendary items in the pool and the Recycler cannot recycle something into the same object.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Life finds a way.

When this is picked up, all stacks of Ukuleles will be converted into an equal number of Polylute stacks. In addition, all future Ukuleles picked up will be immediately converted into more Polylutes.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Polylute has a proc coefficient of 0.2, like the  Ukulele.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Polylute is in theory similar in power to Ukulele. Ukulele applies TOTAL\u00d780% on 3 other targets, while Polylute applies TOTAL\u00d760% on the same target 3 times. While losing the area-of-effect of Ukulele seems to be significant, Polylute allows the holder to kill the original target much faster and then turn their attention to other enemies.\nHowever, the Polylute supersedes the Ukulele in power when there are 2 or fewer enemies near the original target.

            "notes": "Safer Spaces is a void item in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of  Tougher Times.\nWhen the holder would take damage, if this item is charged, the damage is completely negated, displaying \"Blocked!\" instead of a damage number. After blocking damage, the item must recharge for 15 seconds (-10% per stack) before another hit can be negated.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nChoosing between Safer Spaces and Tougher Times can depend on what enemies you encounter during your run. Safer Spaces can be used for a guaranteed block against burst damage enemies like   Lunar Chimera (Golem),   Stone Golem, and   Mithrix. Tougher Times has no cooldown, allowing it to block multiple hits from enemies that attack rapidly, such as   Clay Templar and   Lunar Chimera (Wisp).\nStacking Safer Spaces or Tougher Times will allow for more frequent blocks. It's possible to reduce Safer Spaces cooldown to 1 frame (0.0167 seconds) with 65 stacks, effectively granting the user immunity to attacks. However, reaching 100% block chance with Tougher Times is impossible; the maximum is 99.9%. 65 stacks of Tougher Times will instead give 90.7% block chance.\nThe   Safer Spaces Ready status effect above the health bar will indicate whether it is charged or not, and a circular shield appears around the Survivor. The effect changes to   Safer Spaces Cooldown while it is recharging, but unlike   Elemental Rings Cooldown and   Singularity Band Cooldown, the recharge period is not indicated with multiple stacks.\nSafer Spaces cannot block damage inflicted by the   Void Fog debuff.\nIt can, however, block damage inflicted by opening a Void Cradle.\nIf this item is on cooldown when the   Mithrix steals it, it will grant instant cooldown restoration on every frame when it is given back, making the player virtually immune to damage for the rest of the stage. This bug can also be triggered by  Wake of Vultures and killing a Voidtouched enemy (more details and a technical explanation can be found in that item's page).\nKeep in mind that upon defeating the third phase, it takes 6 seconds before Mithrix starts stealing items and he does so every 0.21666666 seconds. For 9 stacks of more of this item, the shield cooldown will always expire before Mithrix has a chance to steal it. For fewer stacks, it depends on how many items he has to steal before he steals this.\n  REX can trigger the cooldown on demand with any of its skills that cost HP, which can be timed right before the item is stolen, bypassing any stack requirements.\nThe same applies for   Void Fiend's Void Corruption.\nAny survivor can trigger the cooldown on demand by intentionally taking damage from any lingering sources of damage, i.e., the   Lunar Chimera's (Exploder) blasing pools, and the blue flame pillars created by phase 3 Mithrix.\nTaking fall damage can be relied upon, but the player must be near the ramps at the edge of the arena before killing the third phase in anticipation of this. Having items or equipment that give enough height boost is another alternative. However, playing as   Loader or holding  H3AD-5T v2 makes the player immune to fall damage, making this not a viable method.\nEquipment and skills that can hit the player, i.e.,  Helfire Tincture,  Glowing Meteorite, and   OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike can also be used. Note that Diablo Strike may require precise planning if timing is of the essence.\nWith the Artifact of Chaos survivors can harm themselves.

            "notes": "The Singularity Band is a void item added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of  Runald's Band and  Kjaro's Band. \nWhen striking an enemy with an attack that deals 400% or more base damage, the Band creates a 15m black hole, which pulls enemies in its radius into its center. After 5 seconds, the black hole explodes, dealing 100% (+100% per stack) total damage to all enemies inside its radius. This bonus attack has a cooldown of 20 seconds and a proc coefficient of 1.0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe cooldown for the Singularity Band can be seen above the player's health bar as a {  status effect with up to 20 stacks. 1 stack is removed every second, and when the last stack is removed the Band is {  ready and can be activated again.\nBecause this status effect is considered a debuff, activating the  Blast Shower will reset the cooldown immediately. However,  Ben's Raincoat does not prevent it from being inflicted.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nUnlike its uncorrupted counterparts, this item has a proc coefficient of 1.0, so it can activate certain items such as  Sticky Bomb,  AtG Missile Mk. 1,  Ukulele and  Brilliant Behemoth. Because both Sticky Bomb and Brilliant Behemoth deal area-of-effect damage, they pair extremely well with the black hole effect of the Singularity Band. A single stack of Brilliant Behemoth, for example, will increase the single enemy damage to a total of 160% of the value of the attack that brought the Singularity into existence. More enemies will further increase this value by 60% per enemy (or squared when it comes to total damage).\nIn this situation, it takes just 5 enemies for the total damage of Singularity Bands to surpass that of an equal number of stacks of Kjaro's Band, and just 2 enemies to deal almost as much single-target damage as an equal number of stacks of Runald's Band.\nWhile it has double the cooldown of its uncorrupted counterparts and a 5-second delay when dealing damage, this item has neither the single-target limitation of Runald's Band nor the need for targets to stay close to the activation point of Kjaro's Band.\nHowever, since it cannot pull   Magma and   Overloading Worms, they are very likely to avoid the explosion.\nSince the Singularity Band deals considerably less raw damage than its uncorrupted counterparts, it can be useful for Survivors who lack extremely powerful single-hit skills but who can still activate the Bands with their skills. In this case, the Singularity Band's utility for grouping up enemies may be more useful than the pure damage of Kjaro's and Runald's Bands.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Whether light brightens or fades,\n\nWhether space holds or buckles,\n\nWe will draw near.\n\nWe will end as one.\"\n\n-The Syzygy of Io and Europa, Apocryphal Verse\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.4.0\nSingularity Band could no longer activate itself again\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Singularity Band\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nPrior to Patch 1.2.4, the Singularity Band did not have a proper proc chain mask. Because the black hole has a proc coefficient, by clearing the cooldown debuff with the Blast Shower before it collapses, the Singularity Band could activate itself again. With more than 1 stack, each subsequent black hole would deal multiple times as much damage as the previous one.",

The blast has a 12m (+2.4m per stack) radius and deals 260% (+156% per stack) base damage. This damage suffers from sweet spot damage falloff.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item's effect triggers 0.2 seconds after the initial hit, meaning this item won't benefit from  Crowbar's damage boost unless the triggering hit deals less than 10% of the target's health (including other instances of Voidsent Flame).\nSimilar to the Crowbar, this item becomes harder to use with offensive drones and other players, as a single hit from anyone other than the holder will prevent Voidsent Flame from activating.\nSince barrier does not count towards full health, if an enemy has any barrier while being at full health, e.g., a Scavenger with Topaz Brooch and activating it with Thqwibs, it is possible for the item to be triggered multiple times for the same target.\nDespite slightly reduced damage, this item can easily become more deadly to enemies in groups than  Will-o'-the-wisp.\nInstead of needing to kill one enemy, the player can simply damage any target to set off a chain reaction of explosions that can wipe out groups of small enemies and heavily damage or even kill larger ones.\nWhen paired with  Gasoline, this effect is even more pronounced, as any enemies that die as a result of Voidsent Flame will also activate Gasoline and strengthen the chain. Afterburn from the Gasoline can even cause enemies to die after a delay, and potentially even trigger against enemies who weren't there for the initial wave of explosions.\n Helfire Tincture can trigger Voidsent Flame's effect on yourself and allies. However, the resulting explosions only damages enemies, resulting in a huge damage boost as long as you stay at or above full health, which can be done using  Repulsion Armor Plate and regeneration,  Planula,  Topaz Brooch,  Aegis, et cetera.\nThis combo is particularly powerful on   Loader due to her ability to counter damage from Helfire Tincture with barrier generated by her primary attack.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n========================================\n====   MyBabel Machine Translator   ====\n====     [Version 12.45.1.009 ]   ======\n========================================\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <102515 cycles>\nComplete!\nDisplay result?

            "notes": "The Blast Shower is an equipment added in the Skills 2.0 Update. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Warm For Life Challenge.\nWhen activated, it removes any and all negative status effects from the user. This includes, but is not limited to, the frozen effect from   Glacial Elite explosions, the   burn from   Blazing Elites, the   Tar applied by explosive pots and   Clay Templars, and even the   heal block applied by   Malachite Elites.\nThe Blast Shower also destroys all projectiles in a very small radius around the player, with emphasis on \"very small.\" Removing incoming projectiles is very difficult, but it reliably clears bombs attached to the player by   Overloading Elite attacks.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n Tonic Afflictions cannot be removed with the Blast Shower, as they are stored in the player's inventory and are not actually a status effect.\nThe acid pools left behind by   Beetle Queens, the fire fields from   Mini Mushrums, and Malachite spike pits are all technically projectiles and as such can be removed by the Blast Shower if the player is standing on them.\nCounterintuitively, the Null Safe Zone barrier effect of the   Void Fields is considered a debuff and is removed, though it is instantly reapplied while inside an active vent. This only results in the player's screen changing color very briefly. This is no longer possible as of the Survivors of the Void Update, due to the Null Safe Zone effect being replaced with   Void Fog.\nThe Blast Shower cleanses timed debuffs and thus does not cleanse   Permanent Armor Reduction and   Permanent Curse (from   Eclipse 8).\nThe Blast Shower does not reset the out-of-combat timer. This means that the regeneration from  Cautious Slug, shields (including from  Transcendence,   Overloading and   Perfected), and the  Oddly-shaped Opal armor buff will not be regenerated when the Blast Shower is used.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe 10 second cooldown of  Runald's Band and  Kjaro's Band is tracked using the stacking   Elemental Rings Cooldown buff, and when all stacks are removed the Bands are   ready. This means that activating the Blast Shower instantly recharges the Bands, making it surprisingly powerful when combined with a  Gesture of the Drowned,  Fuel Cells and/or a  Soulbound Catalyst.\n20 Gestures will reduce the Blast Shower's cooldown to less than 0.5s, which is lower than the minimum cooldown of all skills. Cooldown recovery beyond this will only be beneficial when using items that can activate the Bands, such as  AtG Missile Mk. 1.\nThe cooldown buffs   Singularity Band Cooldown and   Safer Spaces Cooldown function similarly. Continually resetting the cooldown for  Safer Spaces removes the need for stacking the item and allows for higher uptime on damage blocking, to the point of near-invulnerability if enough  Gestures are stacked.\nSimilarly, the Blast Shower recharges  Ben's Raincoat. Although it might seem the items' effects are overlapping and redundant, the Blast Shower can be useful to negate debuffs received while the Raincoat is on cooldown, and to bring its protection back again to defend against more.\nThe Beetle' Queen's flying beetles repeatedly inflict   Beetle Juice on players nearby, and the   Grandparent's solar flare attack continuously inflicts   Burn and  Overheat in a large area. When suffering from these debuffs, the player should make sure to move out of these attacks' areas of effect before using the Blast Shower, or else the debuffs will be immediately reapplied and waste the equipment's charge.\nThe Blast Shower is similarly unhelpful for removing the  Cripple inflicted by the Pillar of Design's repeated shockwaves, and one should just jump over them instead.\nThere are several telegraphed attacks that can be cleansed with Blast Shower's ability to destroy projectiles such as the pools caused by Lunar Chimera (Exploder) and Beetle Queen, the ground attacks of Solus Control Unit, Alloy Worship Unit, Stone Titan, and Clay Apothecary, and the rotating attack used by phase 3 Mithrix\nIn order to properly cleanse these attacks, it is important to stand at the center of the attack, making the pools caused by Lunar Chimera (Exploder) and Beetle Queen less practical to cleanse.\nFollowing this logic, it is possible to cleanse the entire rotating attack used by phase 3 Mithrix with only 4 fuel cells by standing at the intersection of all the pillars and activating Blast Shower's effect whenever the pillar's appear.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Blast Shower\n\nTracking Number: 152*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 06/19/2056\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: Frontier Gate, Outer Edge Zone\n\nShipping Details:\n\nOuter Edge thanks you for your rewards redemption!

The tunnel can be up to 1000 meters long, and interacting with either end of the tunnel will cause the player to travel to the other end.\nEach quantum tunnel lasts 30 seconds and unlike the  Remote Caffeinator there is no limit to how many active tunnels can exist for each user at the same time.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nAny player can go through the quantum tunnel, not just the player who created it.\nA player going through the tunnel can exit early by jumping.\nIf the tunnel expires, the purple zipline will disappear but the player will continue travelling towards their destination as normal.\nEntering the tunnel will immediately end the duration of   Shadowfade.\nThe player is still vulnerable to damage while travelling through the tunnel.\nUpon entering the tunnel, the player accelerates at 30 m/s with an initial speed of 0. Since the maximum distance is 1000, it takes approximately 8.16 seconds to reach the other side with a final speed of approximately 245 m/s. Upon exiting the player retains half the speed they have acquired.\nThe player should be careful about aiming the tunnel towards the ground as a high exit speed can inflict massive fall damage.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis equipment can be used to skip charging pillars on Commencement by creating a tunnel directly to the   final boss's arena.\nThis is especially useful in multiplayer since only one player on the team needs a Vase. Most pillar-skipping strategies require all players to have sufficient mobility items and/or skills.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cOne of Robins\u2019 most loved acts was the pitcher skit. \n\nThe skit would start off with Robins, playing the part of a flower keeper, getting ready to fill a vase with soil. He would pour, pour, and pour, but the vase wouldn\u2019t seem to get any fuller \u2013 as if the soil was disappearing infinitely. \n\nRobins would inspect the vase, looking at it up and down, but there weren\u2019t any holes in the thing. Finally, at the climax, Robins would hold it upside down over his head \u2013 upon which all of the soil poured in would land directly on his face.\u201d\n\n- Biography of Charles Robins\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Eccentric Vase\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\n\ud83c\udf27Thicken zipline visuals\n\ud83c\udf27Zipline Acceleration: 20 \u21d2 30\nCooldown: 100s \u21d2 45s\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4233443)\nBug Fixes\nDying while traveling in Eccentric Vase no longer causes you to pop out the other end alive\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Equipment: Eccentric Vase\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Eccentric Vase's appearance is based on a Klein bottle, a theoretical object with only one surface which cannot be properly visualized in three dimensions without intersecting with itself.",

            "notes": "The Executive Card is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void update.\nWhenever the holder makes a purchase with gold, 10% of the gold spent on that purchase (rounded down) is returned to the holder after a moment. This effect has a 0.1 second cooldown. In addition, when the holder purchases from a Multishop Terminal, Equipment Triple Shop, Triple Drone Shop, or the shop dropped by the  Shipping Request Form, the other terminals will not close and will instead remain open for purchase, allowing the cardholder to get all the items from the Multishop.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nUnlike most other equipment, this item cannot be activated manually; instead, its activation is triggered when purchasing something with gold. This matters for the  War Horn and  Bottled Chaos, which will trigger whenever a purchase is made.\nDue to how equipment cooldowns work, the cash-back effect will not work if the Executive Card is picked up while there is a current equipment cooldown from the previously-held equipment. If the holder makes a purchase while the Executive Card is still on cooldown, Multishop Terminals and their variants will close after making a purchase, and they will not get 10% back on the purchase.\nEquipment charges provided by  Fuel Cells can be used to mitigate this effect, but charges will only be replenished when the cooldown finishes regardless.\nNote that with the Executive Card's cooldown being 0.1 seconds if the player is repeatedly pressing the Interact Key in front of a multishop, it is possible to purchase the second item while the equipment is on cooldown and lose out on the third terminal. Therefore, it is advised to hold down the Interact Key instead, as the frequency with which it registers as pressed will avoid this issue.\nIf held by   MUL-T while using   Retool, the Executive Card will not function if it is not in MUL-T's active equipment slot.\nThe  Functional Coupler functions the same: if the Executive Card is not the currently active equipment, the user will not benefit from it.\n  Captain's   Hacking Beacons will inherit the equipment's passive effect when he holds it and they will be able to hack and buy all three items of Multishop Terminals for free with a single beacon.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThough it denies the use of more powerful active equipment, this item can drastically increase the amount of items picked up from a stage. The holder is also still free to swap out the Executive Card for a different equipment later in the run, once they are satisfied with their extra items.\nThis is especially useful on the fourth and fifth stage environments (  Abyssal Depths,   Siren's Call,   Sundered Grove, and   Sky Meadow) because Multishop Terminals on those stages are guaranteed to contain Uncommon items.\nIf the player is holding an Executive Card while the previous equipment is on cooldown, upon the cooldown expiring all the equipment charges will be effectively refreshed as any remaining cooldowns will use the Executive Card's, which is negligible.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n//--AUTO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM UES [Redacted] --//\n\n\"When you're on the planet, keep a look out for any loose UES Security Chests.

Challenge.\nWhen activated, the player throws a doll in front of them. This doll triggers all on-kill effect items the player has, as if the player had killed an enemy where the doll landed. It does this once per second and eight times in total.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nEach player can have up to 3 dolls active at once, and the equipment cannot be activated again until one of the dolls is used up.\nThis is due to the fact that if the player had a  Soulbound Catalyst and a  Gesture of the Drowned, the Forgive Me Please will activate the Soulbound Catalyst, reducing its own cooldown enough to automatically spawn another doll.  This limit was added since this would escalate to the point where there would be enough dolls and on-kill effects to overload and crash the game.\nThe  Soulbound Catalyst pairs excellently with the Forgive Me Please, where 1 doll reduces the equipment's cooldown by 32 seconds over its 8 second activation period. This creates a 5-second downtime between spawning dolls. Any kills caused by the activated effects of the doll will further reduce this cooldown, even possibly causing the equipment to finish recharging before the current doll expires.\nThe Forgive Me Please has a chance to drop Lunar Coins.\nSince Lunar Coins can activate the pressure plates on   Abandoned Aqueduct, placing the equipment on top of them provides a way, albeit inconsistent and time-consuming, to activate the plates if the player lacks any other resources.\nOn-kill effects that have specific activation conditions will not be activated by Forgive Me Please. These items are:  Brainstalks,   Happiest Mask,  Wake of Vultures,  Shatterspleen, and  Defense Nucleus.\nBrainstalks, Wake of Vultures, and Defense Nucleus will not activate even if the Artifact of Honor is active.\nThe Forgive Me Please will charge  Infusions and the  Resonance Disc.\nThe Forgive Me Please will stick to whatever surface it lands on. This is useful for placing it on an enemy, or an ally surrounded by enemies, as any on-kill effects will consistently hit the target.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nThere is a note pinned to the doll:\n\nAyy, you\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me!\n\nYou\u2019re really killing me.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.0.2.0\nBug Fixes\nFixed throwing Forgive Me Please off a cliff causing it to not release its deployable slot until the next stage\nPC Patch v1.0.1.1 (Build ID No.5440050)\nBug Fixes\nFix Forgive Me Please not triggering  Frost Relic\nFix Forgive Me Please not triggering  Berzerker\u2019s Pauldrons\nFix Forgive Me Please not animating or playing effects on non-host machines\nEarly Access Content Update 5\nMajor Content\nAdded New Equipment: Forgive Me Please\nAdded New Item Lore Entry: Forgive Me Please\nAdded New Challenge:  I Love Dying!\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Forgive Me Please is likely a reference to an item featured in the original Risk of Rain, the Crudely Drawn Buddy.

            "desc": "Looks like it could power something. EXTREMELY unstable...",
            "notes": "The Fuel Array is a single-use equipment introduced in the Scorched Acres Update.\nIt can only be obtained during the first stage, by interacting with a hatch on the back of the Escape Pod that the player spawns from.\nUnlike most other equipment, the Fuel Array cannot be activated normally. Instead, it automatically activates if the holder falls to 50% of their maximum health. When this happens, the Fuel Array triggers a 30m explosion that deals severe fixed damage after  3 seconds; any entity in range of the explosion are damaged for 300% of the holder's maximum health and suffer heavy knockback. This explosion has a proc coefficient of 0.0 and cannot critically strike.\nWhen the Fuel Array is activated and explodes, it is destroyed and removed from the player's inventory, regardless of any  Fuel Cells they have.\nThe main purpose of the Fuel Array is for repairing the broken robot in   Abyssal Depths. If the player interacts with the robot while they have a Fuel Array equipped, it will clear the Power Plant challenge and unlock   REX as a playable Survivor. This will also remove the Fuel Array from the player's inventory.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Fuel Array cannot be selected from Orange Command Essence.\nThe Fuel Array's explosion will damage any entity within its radius.\nThe damage dealt by the explosion is 3 \u22c5 (maxHealth + maxShields) . This can be reduced with armor.\nWith sufficient barriers,   MUL-T can survive the blast while in   Transport Mode or   Power Mode.\n  Mercenary can use   Blinding Assault or   Eviscerate to become   invincible and take no damage from the explosion.\n  Seeker can use   Sojourn to take no damage from the explosion.\nObtaining the  Strides of Heresy gives the player access to the powerful  Shadowfade skill, which makes them completely invulnerable. This is helpful for avoiding damage and healing to keep the Fuel Array from exploding, or for staying alive if it does explode.\nSince the Fuel Array will explode when the player falls under half health, things like fall damage,   Stone Golem lasers, and other high instant-damage sources are much more dangerous than normal.\nActivating a Shrine of Blood with the Fuel Array equipped is guaranteed death, unless the player has built up some extra barriers.\nIt is possible for  Tougher Times to negate the damage taken from the Fuel Array. Likewise,  Safer Spaces can also negate the damage if timed correctly.\nItems and effects that reduce the player's maximum health value will not cause the Fuel Array to explode, as this is not treated as damage dealt.\nThese are the Shaped Glass,  Tonic Affliction, and   Permanent Curse.\n  MUL-T,   Acrid,   Void Fiend and   False Son are unable to obtain the Fuel Array in a single-player run, as they do not begin runs in an Escape Pod.\nIf MUL-T is below 50% health and   switches to the equipment slot containing the Fuel Array, this will instantly begin the countdown. This can be stopped by switching back to the other equipment slot, as long as that other slot is not another Fuel Array.\nIn multiplayer, it is possible to obtain multiple Fuel Arrays, though this can only be done by having another player drop theirs by exchanging it with another equipment item.\nIn multiplayer, if one player uses the Fuel Array to repair REX, only that player will complete the Power Plant challenge, and thus only that player will unlock REX.\nIt is possible for multiple players to repair REX with their own individual Fuel Arrays in the same session.\nIf given to an   Equipment Drone, the Fuel Array will become unusable, and is impossible to recover when the drone dies.\nIf an another equipment is first picked up, and then swapped with the Fuel Array while it is still in the Escape Pod, then the other equipment item's display model will take the Fuel Array's place in the pod.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe Fuel Array's explosion does not bypass one-shot protection, so it can theoretically be weaponized to deal massive area damage if the player's one-shot protection becomes active. This can only be done with large amounts of healing, however, since the player will need to recover at least 40% of their health before the Fuel Array explodes.\nThe  Medkit is triggered only 2 seconds after taking damage while the explosion countdown is 3 seconds.\nThe  Power Elixir heals 75% of the player's health if they have fallen below 25%. Therefore, if the player falls just below 50% to trigger the countdown, they may be incentivized to intentionally take further damage to activate the effect. However, the player cannot fall below 15% health in attempting to trigger this item, as they will not recover sufficient health to then activate the one-shot protection.\nWhen carrying the Fuel Array, the  Old War Stealthkit and  Genesis Loop become nearly useless, as falling below 50% health leads to almost-certain death. However, this also means that the player will always benefit from the  Delicate Watch.\n  Engineer can make excellent use of the Fuel Array's volatile nature, as his   turrets will also have their own Fuel Arrays. While this does cut their lifespan short, they will explode when sufficiently damaged and inflict colossal damage on any enemies nearby.\nThis is especially effective when using Engineer's   TR58 Carbonizer Turrets, which will charge straight towards enemies.\nThis strategy is much more feasible in multiplayer runs than singleplayer, as dying from the Fuel Array will not immediately end the run.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Early Access Patch (Build ID No.4233443)\nBug Fixes\nFix Fuel Array sometimes missing in multiplayer\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3961583)\nGameplay Changes\nIncrease damage of Fuel Array explosion from 100% of your health to 300% of your health\nFuel Array no longer pierces armor\nAdd new graphics to Fuel Array to clarify that it is not a  Sticky Bomb\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Equipment: Fuel Array",

            "notes": "The Remote Caffeinator is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Survivors of the Void expansion.\nWhen activated, after 5 seconds an Eclipse Zero Vending Machine crashes down, dealing 2000% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a 16m radius with sweet spot falloff. The vending machine can then be interacted with up to 12 times for a base cost of 5 gold each time (scaling with difficulty), which dispenses up to 3 cans of soda within 25m at a time depending on how many allies are near. These cans gravitate towards the player or their allies when they get close, each healing 25% of the collector's maximum HP.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item will trigger any on-interaction items such as  Bundle of Fireworks and  Squid Polyp.\nEach entity is limited to one deployed vending machine, so upon deploying a new one, the previous one will be destroyed similar to the   Engineer's turrets.\nThis may be frustrating if the player tries to use the vending machine spawned by an   Equipment Drone, as it will be replaced frequently in the presence of nearby monsters. However, frequent respawning means the vending machine stays close to the player as they explore the stage, while potentially dealing damage to enemies when landing.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe vending machine allows for easy, repeated use of the Bundle of Fireworks and Squid Polyp while in boss arenas or other areas which do not typically have interactables. A few stacks of Fireworks and a  Pocket I.C.B.M. can potentially make quick work of the final bosses, even on higher difficulties.\nThis strategy requires gold to function, and is therefore unusable during the first phase of the   Voidling fight, before normal enemies spawn. However, having a  Brittle Crown or  Roll of Pennies will help this strategy become viable during the fight.\n  Captain can call down a   Hacking Beacon near the vending machine, which will repeatedly and automatically activate it for free (triggering on-interaction items in the process). This strategy does not work in Hidden Realms, however, since Captain cannot use   Orbital Supply Beacon in these stages.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"I sure am thirsty,\" Chen said as he filled a Lemurian with bullets.\n\nLuckily for him, he had found an Eclipse Remote Caffeinator aboard his vessel. Reaching in his pocket, Chen pressed the button marked with the Eclipse logo, and many systems began to whirr to life.\n\nHigh up in the atmosphere, a panel on the hull of the UES Safe Travels slid open with a clunk. Ready to be ejected, an Eclipse Zero Vending Machine (c2038) twinkled valiantly. Silently, the vending machine began its journey down to the surface.\n\nBack down on the planet, Chen was starting to run low on ammunition, and the Lemurians were closing in. But, just when the Lemurians were ready to tear Chen apart, who else but the Eclipse Zero Vending Machine came crashing down, squishing the Lemurians into a fine paste. Climbing up a mound of dead Lemurians, Chen entered 5 standard credits into the machine and ordered his favorite beverage, courtesy of the Eclipse Company. \"Wow, refreshing and life-saving! Eclipse, quenching thirsts no matter where you are!\" Chen smiled, grateful for Eclipse's galaxy-wide service and quality assurance.\n\nThis log entry was brought to you by Eclipse: The Galactic Quencher\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.2.0\nBug Fix\nFixed \u2018Remote Caffeinator\u2019 DLC equipment being locked permanently\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Equipment: Remote Caffeinator\n(Undocumented) This equipment cannot be picked up in game\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe company name \"Eclipse\" is a reference to   Eclipse mode, a highly challenging alternate game mode which progresses through a series of increasingly difficult modifiers. Since the vending machine is referred to with \"Eclipse Zero,\" and because Eclipse's levels range from 1 to 8, this may signify how the vending machine's healing makes the consumer's life easier, bringing their Eclipse level even lower than normal.\nIronically,   Eclipse 5 halves the soda's effectiveness, so the promise of life-saving beverages rings somewhat hollow in a real Eclipse run.\nThe vending machine displays 6 soda cans with most likely another 6 behind them. When the interactable has fewer than 6 activations left, this will be depicted in the display accordingly.",

Additionally, after the initial strike, each saw blade deals 140% damage rapidly with a proc coefficient of 0.2 and inflicts Bleed each tick.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of 100% damage is incorrect.\nUsing this equipment to hit enemies at close range is risky but rewarding, as it is likely that all 3 saw blades will hit.\nKeep in mind that the saw blades do not travel through terrain, and each will immediately return upon striking terrain.\nThis can be used to return the saw blades early in order to get the second hit for each blade faster, although this requires some setup.\nThis also means that it's possible to get a saw blade stuck on its return trip, if the player moves such that there is geometry between them and the saw blade before it returns.

Both the Equipment Drone and Strike Drones will follow the player nearly all the time, since the Equipment Drone reduces its equipment's cooldown by about 80%.\nThis is especially useful as Captain, as the Equipment Drone and the Strike Drones will get Defensive Microbots.\nDue to its 100 second cooldown, it's best to use this against a horde of enemies or during the Teleporter Event, as the drones have a high rate of fire and can draw enemies' attention.\nThis item has a hard limit of 20 drones that can be active at any one time.

            "notes": "The Crowdfunder is an equipment in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Funded! Challenge.\nIt is different from most equipment in that it has no cooldown; instead, activating the Crowdfunder toggles it between an \"on\" and \"off\" state. When activated, the Crowdfunder will fire 3 shots per second, slowly increasing its fire rate over 10 seconds and visibly spinning faster. Once spun up, it fires 15 shots per second. Each bullet fired from the Crowdfunder deals 100% damage with default damage falloff and a proc coefficient of 1.0, but also costs the holder 1 gold per shot (though this cost scales with the holder's level).\nIf the holder has no gold remaining, the Crowdfunder stops firing, but will immediately begin firing again once the holder gains enough gold to finance it.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of Cost increases over time. is incorrect. The cost of each shot fired is equal to: 1 + (player level - 1)/4\nThe Crowdfunder's attacks are actually hitscans; the \"bullets\" fired are purely visual.\n Fuel Cell and  Bottled Chaos have no effect when using the Crowdfunder.\nThis makes it an especially good equipment option when using  Lysate Cells.\nHaving a  Gesture of the Drowned causes the Crowdfunder to always be active. This can make it difficult to buy anything, as the player is constantly losing gold. This is particularly problematic in the early game, when players likely do not have the firepower to rapidly kill monsters (and the monsters do not drop much gold anyways), but it becomes less of an issue late game due to difficulty scaling, as mentioned previously.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nAlthough giving up gold for damage may not initially seem like a good tradeoff, the Crowdfunder's sheer damage output more than makes up for it. For reference, at its maximum fire rate, the Crowdfunder deals 2.5 times as much damage per second as   Commando's   Double Tap, with 2.5 times the procs as well.\nSince enemy level and gold drops increase considerably faster than player level (especially on higher difficulty), the Crowdfunder's consumption of gold is rarely an issue past the second stage, especially if the player has  Ghor's Tome,  Roll of Pennies or a  Brittle Crown.\nThe Crowdfunder becomes self-sustaining while holding the  Brittle Crown, but the player must not take damage and thus lose gold.\nHaving the Artifact of Sacrifice enabled can make the Crowdfunder more usable, since players will not need money to obtain most items.\nThe Crowdfunder can be a great way to get multiple stacks of effects such as bleed.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: The Crowdfunder\n\nTracking Number: 783*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 05/09/2056\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: 206 29th Ave, High Chariot, Mercury \n\nShipping Details:\n\nThe wealthy overlords on Primas V went to great measures to break the will of the lower class.

Any remaining charges afterwards will simply send \"Ahoy!\" instead.\nBe wary of picking up  Gesture of the Drowned while holding the Tricorn, or vice-versa, as it will cause the Tricorn to be immediately used on the first applicable boss that the player looks at. This may result in the dropped item being unobtainable if the boss in question is over a pit or some otherwise inaccessible terrain at the time, or may net the player a boss item that they are uninterested in.\nSince this item is single-use and cannot be activated at all under most circumstances, giving it to an   Equipment Drone might be worth considering, as this can free up the player's personal equipment slot for something more useful in the long-term.

Glowing blue rings indicate where the meteors will strike, giving players a chance to navigate through them safely (although the random nature of the strikes means that damage is sometimes unavoidable).  \nEach meteorite deals 600% damage to both players and monsters with a proc coefficient of 1.0, suffering from linear damage falloff. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nNo actual projectiles are created by the Glowing Meteorite; instead, the game simply places explosions on the ground near characters. This means that explosions will still spawn inside caves or under ceilings, and  Defensive Microbots cannot protect the player from meteors.\nWhen activating the Teleporter, since monster spawns are concentrated inside the Teleporter's radius, nearly all the meteors will fall inside or near the Teleporter.\nMultiple uses of the Glowing Meteorite (with  Fuel Cells or sufficient cooldown reduction) stack, causing more meteors to fall.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Artificer's   ENV Suit makes her jumps much more floaty than other characters', making dodging meteor strikes easier; a full-height jump followed by a hover can easily avoid most meteor strikes that don't land directly on top of her.\nFor extra security, Artificer can use   Ion Surge to fly high above the ground, allowing her to rain down destruction with impunity.\nThe  Strides of Heresy can help the player dodge meteor strikes and recover any HP they may have lost. This becomes especially effective when stacking the Strides, enabling the player to spend large amounts of time invulnerable while the meteors fall.\nThe  Soulbound Catalyst is particularly effective at recharging the Glowing Meteorite's cooldown, as any kill scored by the meteors will instantly reduce its cooldown. Given the high damage of the meteors and the fact that they attack all across the map, just a single use of the Glowing Meteorite will be almost sure to score several kills.\nIf the player is confident in their ability to navigate the meteors, giving the Glowing Meteorite to an   Equipment Drone can devastate enemies easily. Due to the Equipment Drone's large cooldown reduction, it will automatically use the Meteorite approximately every 28 seconds. This strategy becomes progressively more dangerous as the run goes on, however, since Equipment Drones use the ambient run level and not the player's level.\nFor reference, an Equipment Drone has the same base damage stat as a   Brass Contraption, and each meteor strike inflicts more damage than a single Brass Contraption spike ball (600% versus 500%). In long runs, dying to the Equipment Drone becomes a very real possibility as its stats increase.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nWhat a... peculiar piece of the stars that serendipity has brought us.

Once a character leaves the fire or the Tincture's effect expires, the Helfire debuff persists for an additional 3 seconds. \nThe Helfire debuff deals damage 5 times per second. Each tick deals 0.5% of the holder's max health to themself, 0.25% of their max health to other allies, and 24% of their max health to enemies. This means that the damage per second is 2.5%, 1.25%, and 120% of the holder's maximum health to themself, to allies, and to enemies, respectively.\nThe Helfire debuff is nonlethal to the holder, so it will never bring them below 1 HP. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of dealing 5% of your maximum health to yourself and 2.5% to allies is technically correct, but does not account for how all friendly-fire damage (including self-inflicted damage) is halved.\nCorrection: The in-game description of 8m radius is incorrect, and the description does not specify the duration.\nSurvivors with natural armor take less damage from Helfire Tincture.\nIt's possible to gain permanent uptime of the flames by having a  Gesture of the Drowned and at least 4  Fuel Cells, though proper preparations must be taken to ensure the player can stay alive.\nAlthough the Helfire debuff is invisible, it still counts towards the  Death Mark.\nHowever, the  Ignition Tank changes the Helfire debuff into {  Stronger Burn, which will combine with other affected fire sources such as  Gasoline.\n Ignition Tank provides increased burn damage to enemies and yourself making the choice risky but powerful. Despite the increased self damage, the burn  is never lethal.\nAllies can still die from the burn caused by  Ignition Tank, so be wary when using this combo near drones or other players.\n\n\n== Item Effects ==\n\n\n=== Beneficial ===\n Tougher Times can block self-damage ticks.\n Repulsion Armor Plate reduces the damage taken while on fire, and because it ticks extremely fast for low amounts, it's easy to reduce burning damage taken to 1.\nCombining Armor Plates with the  Planula can result in a steady healing over time effect. This theoretical build is limited by Planula\u2019s scarcity.\nSince the  Focus Crystal is a global damage increase, it will increase the damage done to burning enemies. However, its range is slightly smaller than the flames' area of effect (13m versus 15m), so the player will need to get slightly closer to enemies to reap the benefits.\nFocus Crystal will give a damage boost against allies including other players.\n Razorwire will activate each tick of burning, firing 5 times per second and rapidly triggering on-hit effects.\nPairing the Razorwire with on-hit healing from the  Leeching Seed or  Harvester's Scythe gives the player automatic healing as long as enemies are within the Razorwire's range.\nAn Aegis can add a considerable barrier with enough on-hit healing.\nStacking Tougher Times will occasionally prevent the Razorwire from activating. It is important to find a balance between Tougher Times, Razorwire, and on-hit healing.\n Titanic Knurl,  Infusion,  Bison Steak,  Pearl,  Irradiant Pearl, and  Stone Flux Pauldron increase the damage dealt by the flames while simultaneously increasing survivability.\nHaving more max health increases the damage dealt, but likewise increases the damage taken, so more Repulsion Armor Plates are necessary. Taking 1 Repulsion Armor Plate per 1000 max health reduces each self-damage tick to 1.\n Mired Urn helps the player automatically heal when close to enemies, and inflicts {  Tar to slow them down and keep them in the burning area. It also pairs well with Focus Crystal by draining even more health.\nHaving two  Bustling Fungi allows the player to stand still and recover HP at a higher rate than the Tincture burns them.\n Weeping Fungus can accomplish the same thing but allows the player to continue moving.\nAll of the healing strategies above are greatly enhanced by the  Rejuvenation Rack.\nThe  Corpsebloom's recovery ceiling is lower than the self-injury inflicted by the Tincture and still affords the bonus healing that Rejuvenation Rack does. However, the Corpsebloom prevents the player from healing excessively, making Aegis practically useless and damage from enemies difficult to recover from.\n Voidsent Flame will trigger on the player if the burn ticks while at full health. However, these explosions do not deal self-damage, resulting in a huge damage boost with no downside as long as they can stay at full health.   Aegis is the best way to accomplish this.\nWhile shields do make it more difficult to use this strategy, as long as the combined value of the player's health, shields, and barrier is greater than their combined maximum health and shields, Voidsent Flame will still trigger.\n Transcendence will make all burn damage negligible, as the player's max health becomes 1.\nThe same effect happens upon killing a {  Perfected Elite while holding the  Wake of Vultures.\nA lesser effect happens when the player gains the {  Overloading buff by killing an Overloading Elite while holding the Wake of Vultures, where half of their max health becomes shields. This means that, for the duration of the Overloading buff, all damage taken from and dealt by the Tincture is halved.\n\n\n=== Detrimental or useless ===\n Medkit is near-useless because of how rapidly the burn damage ticks, constantly resetting the 2 seconds necessary to recover. The only way to make use of a Medkit is to proc Tougher Times many times in a row.\nThe barrier from  Topaz Brooch is consumed almost instantly, and\u2014in the late-game\u2014the stack requirement becomes too high to be sustainable.\n Personal Shield Generator and all shield effects do not increase the damage dealt, and shields require 7 seconds without taking damage to replenish.\n Cautious Slug will never activate because the player is constantly taking damage.\n Rose Buckler can reduce incoming burn damage, but the effect is considerably smaller than a single Repulsion Armor Plate. The armor granted is still useful for approaching enemies.\n Shaped Glass should be avoided as the damage from this item is based on max health, not base damage. Halving your health will halve the damage that the Helfire Tincture deals.\nThe  Ignition Tank will multiply the damage on enemies and allies. Without plenty of healing, even one stack can make the self-burn damage get out of hand by dealing 10% of the user's maximum health per second as self damage.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n========================================\n====   MyBabel Machine Translator   ====\n====     [Version 12.45.1.009 ]   ======\n========================================\nTraining... <100000000 cycles>\nTraining... <1453461 cycles>\nComplete!\nDisplay result?

            "notes": "The Spinel Tonic is a lunar equipment introduced in the Scorched Acres Update. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Cosmic Explorer Challenge.\nActivating the Tonic will   dramatically increase all the player's stats for 20 seconds, but after this buff wears off there is a 20% chance to gain a  Tonic Affliction; the affliction reduces all stats by 5% (-5% per stack) if the player is not under the Tonic's buff. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nWhile the   Tonic Buff is active, the in-game character model emits dark bursts of liquid, the screen becomes tinted blue, and the camera's FOV increases.\nThe stat bonuses (other than armor) for this buff are unique in that they are multipliers. For example, not only does the attack speed buff give 70% bonus attack speed, it makes all other attack speed buffs 70% stronger, so a  Soldier's Syringe would give 25.5% bonus attack speed instead of the normal 15%.\nThe chance to get a  Tonic Affliction is affected by Luck. This means that with a single  57 Leaf Clover, the player's chance to get an affliction is reduced to 4%. However, having a single  Purity instead will increase the affliction chance to 36%.\nHaving enough Tonic Afflictions can reduce a survivor's maximum health to 1 HP. Unlike  Shaped Glass, further stacks do not kill the player.\nThe chance to acquire an affliction is determined when the Spinel Tonic is activated.\nThe Tonic Afflictions are not given to the player until the tonic buff wears off, meaning that if the equipment is activated multiple times and then the tonic buff ends, multiple stacks of Tonic Affliction can be gained at once.\nThis can be avoided by advancing to the next stage, which removes the tonic buff without giving any Tonic Afflictions.\nThe Tonic Affliction is added directly to the player's inventory.\nTonic Afflictions can be avoided if the buff is kept up continually, and all afflictions have their effects negated while the buff is active.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe +300% regeneration applies to  Cautious Slug,  Titanic Knurl, and   Acrid's Regenerative buff, making them all 4 times as powerful.\nExtremely powerful when paired with the  War Horn, as it's 70% attack speed buff becomes 119%, and if you have 4  War Horns the attack speed buff will last for the entire duration of the tonic.\nThis equipment is not as effective when playing as   Engineer, as his turrets are not affected by the buff but still inherit all of his afflictions.\nUsing the Tonic as the   Heretic will quickly lead to her death, since it quadruples her negative health regeneration.\nPairing this with the  Transcendence allows the Heretic to use the Tonic, since it sets her regeneration to 0. This comes at the cost of being unable to heal normally, however.\nIt's possible to gain permanent uptime and avoid the buff wearing off by having a  Gesture of the Drowned and at least 3  Fuel Cells.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe Tonic Affliction debuff will reduce a victim's HP by 1 - 1 / ( 1 + 0.1 \u22c5 amount of afflictions)\nAll other stats are reduced by 1 - 0.95 ^ amount of afflictions\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cReality is whatever the mind decides it to be. Take a sip of the drink, and the mind becomes malleable. From there, you can shape it into whatever form you please... and the world around you follows your example.\u201d\n\n- Sigibold the Drunken\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Spinel Tonic\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nBug Fixes\nFix description of Spinel Tonic incorrectly providing the effect duration as 15 seconds instead of the 20 seconds it is in-game\nEarly Access Patch (Build ID No.3961583)\nBug Fixes\nFix Tonic Affliction reducing maximum health and also applying curse health reduction on top of it\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Lunar Equipment: Spinel Tonic\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nBefore the Skills 2.0 update, using a Shrine of Order would remove all Tonic Afflictions from a character.",
