    "notes": "The Blast Shower is an equipment added in the Skills 2.0 Update. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Warm For Life Challenge.\nWhen activated, it removes any and all negative status effects from the user. This includes, but is not limited to, the frozen effect from   Glacial Elite explosions, the   burn from   Blazing Elites, the   Tar applied by explosive pots and   Clay Templars, and even the   heal block applied by   Malachite Elites.\nThe Blast Shower also destroys all projectiles in a very small radius around the player, with emphasis on \"very small.\" Removing incoming projectiles is very difficult, but it reliably clears bombs attached to the player by   Overloading Elite attacks.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n Tonic Afflictions cannot be removed with the Blast Shower, as they are stored in the player's inventory and are not actually a status effect.\nThe acid pools left behind by   Beetle Queens, the fire fields from   Mini Mushrums, and Malachite spike pits are all technically projectiles and as such can be removed by the Blast Shower if the player is standing on them.\nCounterintuitively, the Null Safe Zone barrier effect of the   Void Fields is considered a debuff and is removed, though it is instantly reapplied while inside an active vent. This only results in the player's screen changing color very briefly. This is no longer possible as of the Survivors of the Void Update, due to the Null Safe Zone effect being replaced with   Void Fog.\nThe Blast Shower cleanses timed debuffs and thus does not cleanse   Permanent Armor Reduction and   Permanent Curse (from   Eclipse 8).\nThe Blast Shower does not reset the out-of-combat timer. This means that the regeneration from  Cautious Slug, shields (including from  Transcendence,   Overloading and   Perfected), and the  Oddly-shaped Opal armor buff will not be regenerated when the Blast Shower is used.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThe 10 second cooldown of  Runald's Band and  Kjaro's Band is tracked using the stacking   Elemental Rings Cooldown buff, and when all stacks are removed the Bands are   ready. This means that activating the Blast Shower instantly recharges the Bands, making it surprisingly powerful when combined with a  Gesture of the Drowned,  Fuel Cells and/or a  Soulbound Catalyst.\n20 Gestures will reduce the Blast Shower's cooldown to less than 0.5s, which is lower than the minimum cooldown of all skills. Cooldown recovery beyond this will only be beneficial when using items that can activate the Bands, such as  AtG Missile Mk. 1.\nThe cooldown buffs   Singularity Band Cooldown and   Safer Spaces Cooldown function similarly. Continually resetting the cooldown for  Safer Spaces removes the need for stacking the item and allows for higher uptime on damage blocking, to the point of near-invulnerability if enough  Gestures are stacked.\nSimilarly, the Blast Shower recharges  Ben's Raincoat. Although it might seem the items' effects are overlapping and redundant, the Blast Shower can be useful to negate debuffs received while the Raincoat is on cooldown, and to bring its protection back again to defend against more.\nThe Beetle' Queen's flying beetles repeatedly inflict   Beetle Juice on players nearby, and the   Grandparent's solar flare attack continuously inflicts   Burn and  Overheat in a large area. When suffering from these debuffs, the player should make sure to move out of these attacks' areas of effect before using the Blast Shower, or else the debuffs will be immediately reapplied and waste the equipment's charge.\nThe Blast Shower is similarly unhelpful for removing the  Cripple inflicted by the Pillar of Design's repeated shockwaves, and one should just jump over them instead.\nThere are several telegraphed attacks that can be cleansed with Blast Shower's ability to destroy projectiles such as the pools caused by Lunar Chimera (Exploder) and Beetle Queen, the ground attacks of Solus Control Unit, Alloy Worship Unit, Stone Titan, and Clay Apothecary, and the rotating attack used by phase 3 Mithrix\nIn order to properly cleanse these attacks, it is important to stand at the center of the attack, making the pools caused by Lunar Chimera (Exploder) and Beetle Queen less practical to cleanse.\nFollowing this logic, it is possible to cleanse the entire rotating attack used by phase 3 Mithrix with only 4 fuel cells by standing at the intersection of all the pillars and activating Blast Shower's effect whenever the pillar's appear.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Blast Shower\n\nTracking Number: 152*****\n\nEstimated Delivery: 06/19/2056\n\nShipping Method: Standard\n\nShipping Address: Frontier Gate, Outer Edge Zone\n\nShipping Details:\n\nOuter Edge thanks you for your rewards redemption!
