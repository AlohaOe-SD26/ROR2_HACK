    "desc": "Hits that deal more than 400% damage also fire a black hole that draws enemies within 15m into its center . Lasts 5 seconds before collapsing, dealing 100% (+100% per stack) TOTAL damage. Recharges every 20 seconds. Corrupts all Runald's and Kjaro's Bands .",
    "notes": "The Singularity Band is a void item added in the Survivors of the Void expansion, and the corruption of  Runald's Band and  Kjaro's Band. \nWhen striking an enemy with an attack that deals 400% or more base damage, the Band creates a 15m black hole, which pulls enemies in its radius into its center. After 5 seconds, the black hole explodes, dealing 100% (+100% per stack) total damage to all enemies inside its radius. This bonus attack has a cooldown of 20 seconds and a proc coefficient of 1.0.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThe cooldown for the Singularity Band can be seen above the player's health bar as a {  status effect with up to 20 stacks. 1 stack is removed every second, and when the last stack is removed the Band is {  ready and can be activated again.\nBecause this status effect is considered a debuff, activating the  Blast Shower will reset the cooldown immediately. However,  Ben's Raincoat does not prevent it from being inflicted.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nUnlike its uncorrupted counterparts, this item has a proc coefficient of 1.0, so it can activate certain items such as  Sticky Bomb,  AtG Missile Mk. 1,  Ukulele and  Brilliant Behemoth. Because both Sticky Bomb and Brilliant Behemoth deal area-of-effect damage, they pair extremely well with the black hole effect of the Singularity Band. A single stack of Brilliant Behemoth, for example, will increase the single enemy damage to a total of 160% of the value of the attack that brought the Singularity into existence. More enemies will further increase this value by 60% per enemy (or squared when it comes to total damage).\nIn this situation, it takes just 5 enemies for the total damage of Singularity Bands to surpass that of an equal number of stacks of Kjaro's Band, and just 2 enemies to deal almost as much single-target damage as an equal number of stacks of Runald's Band.\nWhile it has double the cooldown of its uncorrupted counterparts and a 5-second delay when dealing damage, this item has neither the single-target limitation of Runald's Band nor the need for targets to stay close to the activation point of Kjaro's Band.\nHowever, since it cannot pull   Magma and   Overloading Worms, they are very likely to avoid the explosion.\nSince the Singularity Band deals considerably less raw damage than its uncorrupted counterparts, it can be useful for Survivors who lack extremely powerful single-hit skills but who can still activate the Bands with their skills. In this case, the Singularity Band's utility for grouping up enemies may be more useful than the pure damage of Kjaro's and Runald's Bands.\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\"Whether light brightens or fades,\n\nWhether space holds or buckles,\n\nWe will draw near.\n\nWe will end as one.\"\n\n-The Syzygy of Io and Europa, Apocryphal Verse\n\n\n== Version History ==\nPC Patch v1.2.4.0\nSingularity Band could no longer activate itself again\nSurvivors of the Void\n(Undocumented) Added New Item: Singularity Band\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nPrior to Patch 1.2.4, the Singularity Band did not have a proper proc chain mask. Because the black hole has a proc coefficient, by clearing the cooldown debuff with the Blast Shower before it collapses, the Singularity Band could activate itself again. With more than 1 stack, each subsequent black hole would deal multiple times as much damage as the previous one.",
