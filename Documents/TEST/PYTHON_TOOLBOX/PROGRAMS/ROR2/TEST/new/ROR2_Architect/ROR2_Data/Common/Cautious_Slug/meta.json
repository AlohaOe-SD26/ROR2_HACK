    "notes": "The Cautious Slug is an item in Risk of Rain 2. \nAfter the holder avoids damage for 7 seconds, their health regeneration is increased by 3 HP per second (+3 HP/s per stack) until they take damage again. Additionally, this regeneration increases by 0.6 HP/s (+0.6 HP/s per stack) per player level. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nCorrection: The in-game description of out of combat is wrong. It is active when you are out of danger.\nThe extra heal is treated as passive regeneration, so the Cautious Slug does not inhibit completing the Naturopath challenge.\nThis also means that this item is unaffected by the  Corpsebloom.\nThe Cautious Slug is very effective on the   Heretic, as two stacks can negate her negative regeneration entirely as long as the player avoids damage (which is made easier thanks to her   Shadowfade skill).\n\n\n== Lore ==\n\u201cOne of the most crucial things to remember about having an animal companion is that your relationship is built on trust. Though humans are perceptive, we tend to be blinded by what we see \u2013 and we ignore the dangers that lurk beyond our vision. Animals, and other xenobiology, can sense things we can\u2019t. \n\nSo always remember: if your companion warns you of danger in the dark, you had better well listen.\u201d\n\n- Caring for your Pets, Volume III\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Cautious Slug\nQuality of Life\nUpdate visuals to match other assets\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\n[Undocumented] Regen Rate: 300%(+300% per stack) \u21d2 3(+3 per stack)\nEarly Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nRegen Rate: 250%(+250% per stack) \u21d2 300%(+300% per stack)\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThis item is the successor to the Sprouting Egg from Risk of Rain 1, which has a virtually identical effect.",
