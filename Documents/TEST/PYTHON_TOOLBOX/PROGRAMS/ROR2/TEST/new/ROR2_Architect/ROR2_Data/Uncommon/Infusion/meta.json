    "notes": "The Infusion is a returning item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Slaughter Challenge.\nWhen the holder kills an enemy, their maximum health increases by 1 (+1 per stack), up to a maximum of 100 (+100 per stack) bonus health.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n  Turrets spawned by an   Engineer will have the Infusions and their effects, but since they do not share kill counts with Engineer, they do not benefit from any bonus health until they make their own kills.\nIf all Infusions are removed via a 3D Printer or otherwise, the bonus health is lost.\nIf any Infusions are regained, all bonus health is instantly restored, even if the bonus health is more than 100 per held Infusion.\nIf the Artifact of Glass is active, an Infusion's health gain to kill ratio is changed from 1:1 to 1:10.\nThis item does not count as a healing item, and thus does not invalidate the requirements for the Naturopath challenge.\nDestroying explosive pots on Abandoned Aqueduct, Fusion Cells on Rallypoint Delta, Alloy Vulture Nests on Siren's Call, flying rocks on Sky Meadow, or birds on Distant Roost will give a charge of infusion.\n Forgive Me Please will give a charge of Infusion for every time it triggers.\nHaving any number of Infusions will make the health bar red, instead of the normally green color.\nIt is possible for a single Infusion to give more than 100 health per stack if multiple enemies are killed at the same time and the kill count for the infusion is close to its cap.\nThe red particle effect that seeks out the player after having killed an enemy while having an Infusion is what gives the bonus health, and not the kill itself.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Infusion\n\nTracking Number: 768******\n\nEstimated Delivery: 02/8/2056\n\nShipping Method: Priority/Biological\n\nShipping Address: Rage Valley, Fleet Hanger, Mars\n\nContains samples from bears, leeches, tigers, elephants, elephant sharks, sharks, bull sharks, ants, and anteaters. Simply hook up to a dialysis machine along with the necessary equipment and swap out your blood for genetically superior ones! \n\nYou can add whatever blood sample you want, as far as I know. Just make sure you take the pills that allow the body to accept the new blood, or your body will reject the cross-species infusion. Remember that sampling from other animals is a great basis for experimentation!\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Infusion\nEarly Access Artifacts Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nMax Health per kill: 1 hp \u21d2 1 hp (+1 per stack)\nDeveloper Notes: The cap remains unchanged, but it will fill up faster.",
