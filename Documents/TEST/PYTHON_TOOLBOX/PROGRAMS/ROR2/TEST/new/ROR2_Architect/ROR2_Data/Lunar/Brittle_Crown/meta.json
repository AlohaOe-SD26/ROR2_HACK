    "notes": "The Brittle Crown is a lunar item in Risk of Rain 2. \nThe player has a 30% chance to gain gold equal to 8%(+8% per stack) of the Small Chest any time they hit an enemy, but they will surrender a percentage of their gold to any enemy that deals damage to them. The proportion of gold surrendered is equal to the proportion of maximum health lost (+100% per stack). Self-inflicted damage, such as from the  Helfire Tincture, will subtract the holder's gold accordingly but return it shortly after.\nThe chance to gain gold when damaging enemies is affected by the proc coefficient. The amount of gold gained is also affected by the difficulty coefficient.\n\n\n== Tips ==\n  Engineer's turrets are affected by the Brittle Crown, but they gain and lose gold independently from the player. Since the turrets cannot use gold in any way, this makes the Brittle Crown effectively useless for them.\n The Crowdfunder becomes self-sustaining with a Brittle Crown, as long as the player can continually hit enemies with it and avoid taking damage.\n\n\n== Math ==\nThe formula for gold earned is: C \u22c5 D \u22c5 2\nC = Number of Brittle Crowns\nD = Difficulty Coefficient\n\n\n=== Shrine of Blood ===\nThe Brittle Crown has a unique interaction with the Shrine of Blood. This is no longer the case after Survivors of the Void, which changed the Brittle Crown's gold loss.\n\nThe amount of gold earned is not added to the total amount of gold when calculating gold lost.\nIf the player has 100 health, 100 gold, and one Brittle Crown, using the Shrine of Blood for the first time will leave them with 75 gold.\nTaking 50% damage, they lose 50% of their gold, leaving them with 50 gold. The shrine always gives 50% of the health taken as gold, so they then gain 25 gold.\nThe Brittle Crown subtracts gold based on the player's fullCombinedHealth, which is their maximum HP plus their maximum shields. This is the same value that Shrines of Blood use, so as long as the player's fullCombinedHealth is more than two times their current gold, using a Shrine of Blood for the first time will net a profit.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nA wretched carnival.\n\nThey were doomed for good reason. Dunepeople of Aphelia: lost, in fanatic worship of parasitic influences. Lemurians: destined to a dead planet, picked clean. Chitin beasts. Automations of death. Why do you bring them home? They were not meant to survive. \n\nI have watched you for ages, from my dead rock - and every century, you disgust me with vanity. You invite vermin into your home. Wretches. Rats. Monsters. Creatures without restraint. Each and every one, planet killers. And yet, you entertain them as guests. Like children, requiring saving and protection.\n\nShe should have died for me. Her gift was wasted on you.\n\nAnd when will we open discussion - dear brother - of all your thin lies? Why do you forbid your guests to leave? To pilot? Why do you fashion great walls and gates? Why do you weave constructs of destruction, if your role is protection? They are entries in your collection. You slaver. Gatekeeper. Hoarder.\n\nYour death is fated. When you die - and you WILL die - I will be ready. I have been patient for millennia. That planet... is mine.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe logbook entry for the Brittle Crown is written from   Mithrix's perspective and references the various species on   Petrichor V and the tragedies that Providence, the main antagonist of the first Risk of Rain, rescued them from.\nIntriguingly, this item and its logbook entry were added to the game before Mithrix was added as a boss.\nSince the gold reward for killing monsters is tied to their amount of gold they are currently holding, if a monster gets access to this item, the gold reward can increase or decrease based on how much they hit the player or get hit respectively. This is only possible when the player has any stacks of  Eulogy Zero and it is a scenario where monsters can gain items for them to be converted to a Brittle Crown, i.e., Artifact of Evolution,   Void Fields, or Simulacrum.\nThe  Roll of Pennies is blacklisted for monsters, but if it were possible to give it to them, they would reward the player with more gold than naturally expected.\nA   Scavenger spawning with  The Crowdfunder is another way to have a monster's gold amount altered, albeit specific to that entity.\n\n\n== Version History ==\nEarly Access Hidden Realms Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nRemove flat gold reduction on Brittle Crown\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nMajor Content and Changes\nAdded New Lore Entry: Brittle Crown\nGameplay Changes\nUpdate Brittle Crown\u2019s item log description to now show stacking behavior",
