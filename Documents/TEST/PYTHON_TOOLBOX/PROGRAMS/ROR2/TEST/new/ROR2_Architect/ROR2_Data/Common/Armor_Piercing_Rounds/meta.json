    "notes": "Armor-Piercing Rounds are an item in Risk of Rain 2. It is unlocked and starts appearing in runs after completing the Advancement Challenge.\nThe item increases damage dealt by 20% (+20% per stack) against Bosses and Hordes of Many spawned by the Teleporter, Bosses spawned during the 5th and 10th wave of the Simulacrum, Special Bosses, and the Umbrae from the Artifact of Vengeance. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nThis item is also effective against the   Lunar Chimera Golems,   Lunar Chimera Wisps, and   Lunar Chimera Exploders that appear in phase 2 of the   final boss fight. It does not have an effect against any Lunar Chimeras that spawn in Phase 3, however.\nThe item will change damage numbers to orange when activated.\nThis item affects enemies with red health bars. This means they will deal extra damage to non-boss Horde of Many monsters, but will not affect naturally spawning boss monsters that are not spawned by the Teleporter Event.\nAny monsters that have  Infusions will have their health bar changed to a reddish color as a result of the Infusions; these are not considered bosses. This is only relevant in the Void Fields, while the Artifact of Evolution is enabled, during the Simulacrum, or while fighting a   Scavenger that spawns with or finds Infusions.\n\n\n== Tips ==\nThis item's damage bonus stacks multiplicatively with other damage-increasing items such as  Lens-Maker's Glasses,  Delicate Watch,  Crowbar and  Focus Crystal; stacking all of these can enable some truly impressive damage numbers.\n\n\n== Lore ==\nOrder: Armor-Piercing Rounds, 50mm\n\nTracking Number: 15***********\n\nEstimated Delivery: 3/07/2056\n\nShipping Method:  Standard\n\nShipping Address: Fort Margaret, Jonesworth System\n\nShipping Details: \n\nAlright, just to clarify, these rounds aren\u2019t faulty. Heck, I\u2019d say they\u2019re better than the standard, but... that\u2019s kind of the problem. I don\u2019t know if it was a new shipment of materials, or a problem with the assembly line, but these rounds are supposed to pierce armor. Not pierce through the armor, five feet of reinforced concrete, a few warehouses, and an armored truck. \n\nCould you guys look into this so we don\u2019t like, violate any Geneva Conventions or anything?\n\n\n== Version History ==\nAnniversary Update\nMajor Content\nAdded New Lore Entry: Armor-Piercing Rounds\nGameplay Changes\nImprove visual effects to be more noticeable\nEarly Access Scorched Acres Content Update\nGameplay Changes\nBonus Damage: 20% (+10% per stack) \u21d2 20% (+20% per stack)",
